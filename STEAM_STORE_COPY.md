# TalentScout — Steam Store Page Copy

## Short Description (< 300 characters)

Every football game puts you in the dugout. This one puts you in the stands with a notebook. Four scouting careers. 22 countries. Build your reputation from non-league touchlines to Champions League shortlists. Your eye for talent is the whole game.

## Long Description (Steam HTML)

```html
Rain in Rosario. A youth cup semifinal that nobody's watching. A left-footed centre-back, 16 years old, reads the game two seconds ahead of everyone on the pitch.

You see it. Nobody else does.

That's the job. That's the whole game.

<h2>You're not the manager. You're the reason the manager has anyone worth picking.</h2>

TalentScout puts you in the role every football game skips over. You don't pick the team. You don't set tactics. You find the talent that makes all of that possible. Someone had to spot Messi before Messi was Messi. In this game, that someone is you.

<b>Watch. Judge. Report.</b>

Attend matches and observe players in real time. Track their first touch, their movement off the ball, their composure under pressure. Flag the moments that matter — the tackle that reads the play two passes ahead, the run nobody else in the ground noticed. Piece it together into a scouting report that puts your reputation on the line.

No star ratings. No attribute screens. Your perception sharpens with every match watched, every player studied. But the readings are never certain — just confidence levels that improve the more you observe. Know when you've seen enough. Know when to trust your gut.

<h2>Build Your Career — Two Ways</h2>

<b>The Club Path:</b> Start as a freelancer at non-league grounds. Earn a part-time contract. Prove yourself into a full-time role. Rise to Head of Scouting with a department budget and a team of analysts under you. Reach Director of Football and shape the club's transfer strategy for a decade.

<b>The Independent Path:</b> Register your own scouting agency. Sell reports on the open market. Build a client list of clubs on retainer. Hire scouts, analysts, and relationship managers. Grow from a home office into an agency HQ. Price your intel, manage your overhead, and survive on the strength of your reputation alone.

Both paths have five tiers. Both start at the bottom. What changes is who you answer to — a club board, or your bank balance.

<h2>Four Ways to Scout. Each One a Different Game.</h2>

<b>Youth Scout</b> — Academy circuits. U-17 tournaments. Grassroots festivals. School matches with no floodlights. Find the wonderkids while they're still playing for their local club. Assess potential ceilings that won't be obvious for years. Place them in academies and earn sell-on clauses when they make it big.

<b>First Team Scout</b> — The manager needs a left-back, under 28, for less than £20M. You've got a week. Miss the deadline and someone else fills your seat. Hit it and you're the reason the squad gets stronger. Opposition analysis, tactical fit assessment, transfer advisory during the window.

<b>Regional Expert</b> — Own your territory. Learn the language. Know every pitch, every prospect, every coach with an opinion. Your local contacts open doors that no database can. Sell regional intelligence packages to multiple clubs. Open satellite offices in your assigned regions.

<b>Data Scout</b> — Query databases. Detect statistical anomalies. Build predictive models for player development. Identify breakouts before they happen. Sell analytics packages and anomaly alert subscriptions. Earn Oracle status through prediction accuracy.

<h2>A Week in the Life</h2>

Plan every week on a drag-and-drop schedule. 45+ activities compete for your time — attend matches, visit academies, run database queries, meet contacts, study for your UEFA A license, negotiate retainer deals, review your analysts' reports, or just rest before a week of international travel.

Every activity costs time. Some cost money. All of them move your career forward — or don't. Choosing what to prioritize is the game within the game.

<h2>Sharpen Your Tools</h2>

Your scouting gets better as you invest in it. Earn progressive licenses from FA Level 1 to UEFA Pro. Take specialization courses — Youth Development Psychology, Tactical Analysis Masterclass, Data Science for Football, language courses that unlock new regions. Upgrade your equipment loadout across five slots: notebook quality, video packages, database access, travel gear, and office space. Every upgrade sharpens your edge.

<h2>The Money Matters</h2>

This isn't just a scouting game — it's a career simulation. Earn income from salaries, report sales, placement fees, retainer contracts, consulting gigs, and sell-on clauses that pay out years after the initial find. Manage expenses: travel, equipment, office rent, employee salaries, course fees, business insurance. Take out loans when cash is tight. Go bankrupt and it's game over for independents.

Your financial health ranges from thriving to overdraft. Every report you sell, every placement you land, every retainer you sign keeps the lights on. Or doesn't.

<h2>A Living Football World</h2>

22 countries across five regions. 350+ clubs with finances, philosophies, and transfer budgets. Seasonal calendars with 38-week seasons, transfer windows that heat and cool, mid-season breaks, and end-of-season shake-ups.

Players develop along realistic arcs — early bloomers, steady growers, late developers. They get injured, lose form, transfer, and retire. The world moves whether you're watching or not.

Rival scouts are hunting the same hidden gems. Your network of agents, coaches, managers, and journalists grows with every relationship you invest in — and decays when you neglect it. High trust unlocks exclusive intel windows. Burned bridges close doors for good.

<h2>Your Reputation Is Everything</h2>

Every report is a bet. Write with low conviction and it's a footnote. Write with table-pound conviction and you're staking your entire career on one assessment. Get it right and your name opens boardrooms. Get it wrong and you'll spend seasons rebuilding trust.

Discover a future star and watch them rise through the ranks — your alumni page tracks every player you found who made it. Miss a red flag on a flop signing and the calls stop coming.

<h2>Built for the Obsessives</h2>

45+ achievements across six categories, from common milestones to legendary feats. 10+ challenge scenarios with unique objectives — The Rescue Job, Wonderkid Hunter, Moneyball, The Last Season. Hall of Fame legacy tracking. Narrative events that chain across seasons — transfer sagas, rivalry battles, personal milestones, economic upheavals.

Community-moddable data files. Create your own leagues, clubs, and player pools. Full accessibility: font scaling, colorblind modes, keyboard navigation. 10 original vocal tracks on the soundtrack.

This is the game for people who watch U-17 tournaments on purpose.

Build your scouting empire. Find the wonderkid before the world does.

<b>You spotted him first.</b>

## About Developer

We built this because Football Manager never let us be the scout. So we made a whole game about it. TalentScout is an indie project built by people who watch youth tournaments for fun, who have opinions about Brazilian second-division left-backs, and who think the person who found the player deserves their own game. Every system is designed to capture the reality of talent identification — the patience, the gut calls, the reputation that takes years to build and one bad report to damage.

## Long Description (Steam HTML)

```html
<h2>You're not the manager. You're the scout.</h2>

Every football game puts you in the dugout. TalentScout puts you on the touchline with a notebook and a decision to make.

<b>Watch. Judge. Report.</b> Attend matches and observe players in real time. No stats screen tells you whether a 17-year-old has the composure to play two leagues higher — that's your call. Write scouting reports that real people read. Get it right and your reputation grows. Get it wrong and they'll stop calling.

<h2>Build Your Career</h2>

Start as a freelance scout at non-league grounds. Prove yourself to earn full-time positions at bigger clubs. Rise through five tiers — from amateur touchlines to Champions League assignments. Go independent and sell reports on the open market, or work your way up to Chief Scout with a team of analysts under you.

<h2>Four Ways to Scout</h2>

<b>Youth Scout</b> — Find the wonderkids before anyone else. Visit academies, attend youth tournaments, and project which teenagers will become world-class.

<b>First Team Scout</b> — Your manager needs a left-back, under 28, for less than £20M. Find them — or lose your job.

<b>Regional Expert</b> — Know every pitch and every prospect in your territory. Your local contacts open doors no outsider can access.

<b>Data Scout</b> — Query databases, detect statistical anomalies, and predict breakouts before they happen. Earn Oracle status through prediction accuracy.

<h2>A Living Football World</h2>

22 countries. 350+ clubs. Seasonal calendars with transfer windows, mid-season breaks, and end-of-season shake-ups. Players develop, decline, transfer, and retire. Rival scouts compete for the same discoveries. Your network of agents, coaches, and contacts grows with every relationship you invest in.

<h2>Your Reputation Is Everything</h2>

Every report you submit is a bet on your judgment. Discover a future star and your name is made. Miss a red flag on a flop signing and your credibility takes years to rebuild. Financial pressure, narrative events, and rival scouts ensure no two careers play out the same way.

# Email 3: Social Proof

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "Built by people who get it" -- recommended
Safe bet: Self-selecting. If you "get it" -- if you're part of this niche -- you open this email. Signals authenticity and insider knowledge. No hype, just credibility.

### B: "We watched 200 hours of youth football for this game"
Bold play: Specific, slightly absurd number that proves obsession. Stands out in any inbox. Some will laugh, some will nod -- both open the email.

### C: "why we made a game about being the scout"
Personal touch: Lowercase, origin-story framing. Feels like a blog post from a dev you'd follow. Conversational, not salesy.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests identity signaling ("people who get it") against proof of obsession ("200 hours"). Reveals whether the audience wants to feel part of a tribe or wants evidence of authenticity.

## Preview Text
"The team behind TalentScout and why this game exists."

## Send Timing
Day -7 -- Tuesday at 7:00 PM local
One week out. The midpoint of the sequence. This is the trust-building email -- social proof and behind-the-scenes authenticity before the urgency emails begin.

One week out.

Before we get into launch-week mode, we want to tell you who's building this thing.

We're a small team. We're not EA. We're not Sports Interactive. We're the people who played FM for thousands of hours and kept saying the same thing:

"Why can't I just be the scout?"

We've played every Football Manager since Championship Manager 01/02. We've run databases on wonderkids. We've argued about whether a 16-year-old's PA justifies a 40M release clause.

We watch youth football. On purpose. For fun.

TalentScout didn't come from a market analysis. It came from a group chat where someone said "what if scouting was the whole game?" and nobody could stop talking about it.

**What we put into it:**

- Researched real scouting methodologies. How professional scouts actually evaluate talent. Not just "pace 17, dribbling 15" -- the way a scout watches movement off the ball, decision-making under pressure, body language after a mistake.
- Built a progression system based on real career paths. Youth scout to chief scout isn't just a title change -- your responsibilities, your network, your access to leagues all shift.
- Talked to the community. Early testers from the FM subreddit, Discord servers, football analytics Twitter. They told us what they wanted. We listened.

**What early testers are saying:**

"This is the game I didn't know I was waiting for. I spent three hours watching U-17 matches and completely forgot I was playing a game."

"Finally. A game that understands why I have a spreadsheet of Colombian forwards under 18."

"The feeling when your recommended player makes the first team. Nothing else in football gaming gives you that."

We built this for the people who think scouting IS the game. If that's you -- you're going to feel at home.

**[JOIN OUR DISCORD]**

Come talk scouting with us. We're in there every day, sharing dev updates, discussing wonderkid archetypes, and taking feedback right up to launch.

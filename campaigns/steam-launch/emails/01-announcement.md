# Email 1: Announcement

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "We built the game FM never gave us" -- recommended
Safe bet: Speaks directly to the FM community's shared frustration. "FM" in the subject line is an instant signal that this email is relevant to them. Clear, specific, positions against the familiar.

### B: "You were never supposed to be the manager"
Bold play: Flips the assumption. Provocative framing that challenges the reader's identity as a virtual manager. Pattern interrupt that makes them think "wait, what?"

### C: "the scouting game we always wanted"
Personal touch: Lowercase, casual, peer-to-peer. Feels like a message from someone in the same Discord server, not a marketing email.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests whether the audience responds more to direct FM community signaling or to identity-challenging provocation. Reveals whether they want to feel seen or want to be surprised.

## Preview Text
"Every football game lets you manage. None let you scout."

## Send Timing
Day -14 -- Tuesday at 7:00 PM local
Two weeks gives enough runway to build anticipation across the remaining emails. Tuesday evening catches the audience in leisure mode -- post-work, scrolling, thinking about games.

Hey,

Quick question. How many hours have you spent in Football Manager's scouting screen?

Sending scouts to South America. Waiting weeks for reports. Scrolling through pages of wonderkids, trying to find the one everyone else missed.

Now another question. Did it ever feel like enough?

We spent years doing the same thing. Youth intake day was Christmas. We had spreadsheets of Brazilian second-division kids we'd been tracking across saves. We watched U-17 highlights for fun.

And every time, we hit the same wall: scouting in FM is a sub-menu. A feature. A thing you do between setting tactics and managing the transfer budget.

We didn't want to manage. We wanted to scout.

So we built the game.

**TalentScout** is a standalone scouting simulation. No tactics screen. No team talks. No press conferences.

You ARE the scout.

You watch youth matches. You attend grassroots tournaments and school games. You write scouting reports. You build a network. You earn a reputation. You find the wonderkid before the world knows his name.

That's the whole game.

We're launching on Steam on [LAUNCH DATE].

**[WISHLIST TALENTSCOUT ON STEAM]**

If you've ever thought "I could've spotted Messi at 13" -- this is the game that lets you prove it.

More details coming soon. But for now: add it to your wishlist. You're going to want to be first.

-- The TalentScout Team

**P.S.** You're not the manager. You're the reason the manager has anyone worth picking. That's the pitch. That's the game.

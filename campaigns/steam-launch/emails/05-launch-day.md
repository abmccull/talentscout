# Email 5: Launch Day

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "TalentScout is live. Go scout." -- recommended
Safe bet: Clear, direct, action-oriented. No ambiguity about what this email is. "Go scout" is a command that puts them in the role immediately.

### B: "The whistle blows."
Bold play: Three words. Football metaphor as a launch announcement. Atmospheric, dramatic, and trusts the reader to know exactly what it means. High open from the engaged, some confusion from the casually subscribed.

### C: "it's here."
Personal touch: Lowercase. Two words. The energy of a friend texting you the moment something drops. No explanation needed -- they've been waiting.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests direct announcement ("is live") against atmospheric brevity ("the whistle blows"). Reveals whether launch-day emails need clarity or drama for this audience.

## Preview Text
"Your scouting career starts right now. Steam link inside."

## Send Timing
Day 0 -- Tuesday at 10:00 AM local
Morning send on launch day. Catches people at the start of their day so the game is on their mind. Morning launches historically perform well on Steam for visibility during the peak browsing window.

TalentScout is live on Steam right now.

**[BUY TALENTSCOUT ON STEAM]**

No more wishlisting. No more waiting. Your scouting career starts today.

Here's what you're walking into:

**Watch.** Youth matches, grassroots tournaments, academy games across multiple countries. Pick your matches. Choose who to watch. Trust your eyes.

**Report.** Write scouting reports that make or break your reputation. Get it right, and the club sends you to bigger leagues. Get it wrong, and you're back to square one.

**Rise.** Youth scout to chief scout. Expand your network. Unlock new regions. Shape a club's entire future through the players you find.

**Discover.** The hidden gem in the Argentine third division. The centre-back at a rainy school game in England who nobody's watching. The 15-year-old who's going to be worth 80 million in five years.

You saw him first. That's the whole point.

**[BUY NOW ON STEAM]**

This is the game for people who watch U-17 tournaments on purpose.

If that's you -- welcome home.

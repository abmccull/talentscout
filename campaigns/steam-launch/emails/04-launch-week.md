# Email 4: Launch Week Hype

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "Your scouting career starts [launch day]" -- recommended
Safe bet: Date-specific. Creates a mental calendar marker. Frames launch day not as a product release but as the start of something personal -- their career.

### B: "3 days until kickoff"
Bold play: Short. Football metaphor. Urgency without desperation. "Kickoff" reframes the launch as a match day -- something the audience emotionally responds to.

### C: "you ready for this?"
Personal touch: Lowercase, direct, conversational. Feels like a friend texting before a big event. Creates excitement through informality.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests personal framing ("your career") against sports metaphor ("kickoff"). Reveals whether the audience connects more with the career fantasy or the match-day energy.

## Preview Text
"[X] days. Here's everything you're getting."

## Send Timing
Day -3 -- Thursday at 7:00 PM local
Three days out. Close enough to feel real, far enough to build one final wave of anticipation. This is the urgency email -- make them feel the countdown.

[X] days.

In [X] days, you can stop wishlisting and start scouting.

Here's what's waiting for you on launch day:

**The scouting world:**
- Youth matches across multiple countries and leagues
- Grassroots tournaments, school games, academy fixtures
- Different weather, different pitches, different levels -- each one hiding potential

**Your career:**
- Start as a youth scout. Prove yourself one report at a time.
- Expand your network. Unlock new regions.
- Work your way to chief scout. Shape an entire club's recruitment.

**The hunt:**
- Watch players live. No star ratings. Trust your eyes.
- Write scouting reports that build your reputation -- or destroy it.
- Find the hidden gem in the third tier that everyone else missed.
- Get the call when your recommended player makes the first team.

**The feeling:**
That moment when a player you spotted at 15 walks onto the first-team pitch for the first time. You saw it coming. Nobody else did.

That's what this game is about.

If you haven't wishlisted yet, now's the time:

**[WISHLIST ON STEAM]**

Already wishlisted? Do us a massive favour -- send this email to one person. That friend who makes wonderkid spreadsheets. The one who watches youth football on YouTube at 2 AM. The one who argues about which Brazilian 16-year-old has the highest ceiling.

They need to know about this.

-- The TalentScout Team

**P.S.** Launch day is [DATE]. We'll send one more email that morning when the game goes live. After that, we shut up and let you scout.

# Email 2: The World

## Subject Line Variants

### A: "What you'll actually do in TalentScout" -- recommended
Safe bet: Direct benefit. Answers the question every interested subscriber has after Email 1. "Actually" signals substance over hype -- no marketing fluff, just the game.

### B: "Rain in Rosario. A youth cup nobody's watching."
Bold play: Scene-setting cold open. Drops the reader into a scouting moment. No context, no explanation -- trusts them to get it. High open rate from the curious, some confusion from the rest.

### C: "from Sunday league to Champions League shortlists"
Personal touch: Lowercase, paints the progression arc in seven words. Feels aspirational without being corporate. Taps the grassroots-to-glory fantasy.

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests clarity vs atmosphere. Do they want to know what the game is, or do they want to feel what it's like? Reveals whether the audience is feature-driven or fantasy-driven.

## Preview Text
"Youth matches. School games. Muddy pitches. Your career."

## Send Timing
Day -10 -- Thursday at 7:00 PM local
Four days after the announcement. Enough gap for the first email to settle, soon enough to maintain momentum. Thursday evening -- the weekend is close, gaming mindset is building.

So you know what TalentScout is. Now here's what you'll actually do.

**You watch matches.**

Not from a tactics screen. Not from a spreadsheet. You're in the stands -- youth cups, grassroots tournaments, school games, academy fixtures. You pick which matches to attend. You decide who to watch.

A 15-year-old in the third tier of Argentine football. Left foot like a wand. Nobody's heard of him yet. That's your job.

**You write reports.**

You've watched the player. Now tell the club what you saw. Rate his attributes. Flag his potential. Recommend -- or don't. Your reputation rides on your judgment.

Get it right, and the club trusts you with bigger matches. Bigger leagues. Bigger stakes.

Get it wrong, and you're back to watching under-14s in the rain.

**You build a career.**

Start as a youth scout covering local pitches. Work your way up:

- Youth scout -- local matches, small network
- Regional scout -- wider territory, more competition
- Senior scout -- first-team targets, international coverage
- Chief scout -- you shape the club's entire recruitment strategy

Your network grows. Your scouting range expands. Your shortlist gets more dangerous.

**You find the wonderkid before anyone else.**

That's it. That's the game. No tactics. No team talks. Just the hunt.

**[WISHLIST ON STEAM]**

Know someone who spends hours hunting wonderkids in FM? Send them this email. They'll thank you later.

**P.S.** We haven't even talked about the eye test yet. Trusting your gut over the data. That's coming. For now -- wishlist and tell a friend.

# Campaign: Steam Launch

## Goal
Drive Steam wishlists pre-launch and convert to purchases on launch day through a 5-email sequence that builds anticipation, establishes credibility, and channels the audience's existing scouting obsession into action.

## Sequence Type
Launch

## Emails
5 emails over 14 days

## Angle
The Untold Role -- every football game lets you be the manager. None let you be the person who actually finds the talent. Until now.

## Audience Segment
FM players, simulation junkies, football fans who obsess over youth development and wonderkids. High jargon tolerance. Deep football knowledge.

## Lead Magnet
N/A (launch sequence -- subscribers opted in for game updates)

## Paid Offer
TalentScout -- standalone scouting simulation on Steam (price TBD)

## Bridge Logic
These are people who already spend hours scouting in FM as a sub-feature. TalentScout makes that obsession the entire game. The bridge is their own existing behaviour.

## Timeline
Day -14 through Day 0

## ESP
Manual / copy-paste (no ESP connected)

## Status
draft

## Voice Notes
Heavy football jargon, casual tone, insider-to-insider register. Short paragraphs. Sentence fragments for impact. Reference FM, wonderkids, regens, scouting reports. Assume the audience knows what all of these mean. Never sounds like a game studio marketing department.

## About This Game

Rain in Rosario. A youth cup semifinal that nobody's watching. A left-footed centre-back, 16 years old, reads the game two seconds ahead of everyone on the pitch.

You see it. Nobody else does.

That's the job. That's the whole game.

TalentScout puts you in the role every football game skips over. You're not the manager. You don't pick the team. You don't set tactics. You're the person who finds the talent that makes all of that possible. Someone had to spot Messi before Messi was Messi. In this game, that someone is you.

**Watch. Judge. Report.**

Attend matches and observe players in real time. No attribute screen tells you whether a 17-year-old has the composure to play two leagues higher. That's your call. Write scouting reports based on what your eyes tell you. Get it right and clubs come calling. Get it wrong and your phone goes quiet.

Your career starts at the bottom. Non-league grounds. Youth tournaments with no floodlights. You prove yourself one report at a time, building a reputation that opens doors to bigger clubs, better assignments, and players who'll actually end up on a first-team pitch.

Four paths. One obsession.

Go deep into youth scouting — the academy circuits, the U-17 tournaments, the 15-year-olds with ceilings nobody else can see yet. Or work first-team assignments where the manager needs a left-back under 28 for less than 20 million and you've got a week to find one. Become the regional expert who knows every pitch and every prospect in your territory. Or build a data scouting operation — query databases, detect statistical anomalies, predict breakouts before they happen.

Each path plays differently. All of them feed the same addiction: being right about a player before anyone else.

**A living football world.**

22 countries. 350+ clubs. Transfer windows open and close. Players develop, decline, transfer, retire. Rival scouts are hunting the same wonderkids you are. Your network of agents, coaches, and contacts grows with every relationship you invest in — and every one of those relationships is a door that opens or closes based on your reputation.

Every report you submit is a bet. Discover a future star and your name carries weight for years. Miss a red flag on a flop signing and you'll spend seasons earning that trust back.

This is the game for people who watch U-17 tournaments on purpose. Who know what PA means without being told. Who have a spreadsheet of Brazilian second-division wonderkids they update for fun.

Build your scouting empire. Find the wonderkid before the world does.

You spotted him first.

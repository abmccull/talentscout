## Storyboard

---

### Beat 1 — Cold Open

**Timestamp:** 0:00 – 0:03
**Duration:** 3 seconds

**Visuals:**
Black screen. Hold for one beat. Then: a single line of game UI fades in — the sidebar header reading "Talent**Scout**" with the emerald "Scout" color treatment, followed by "Week 1 — Season 1" in muted zinc below it.

**Text overlay:**
None. Let the game's own chrome speak.

**Audio:**
Dead silence, then a single ambient crowd murmur — low, distant, a stadium sound a long way off.

**Transition:**
Hard cut to Beat 2.

---

### Beat 2 — The Premise Statement

**Timestamp:** 0:03 – 0:08
**Duration:** 5 seconds

**Visuals:**
A mid-career dashboard (Tier 3 or 4). Sidebar fully populated. Reputation bar at roughly 60%. Inbox notification badge visible. Unreviewed NPC scout reports badge on the Scouts nav item. Hold on this — let the depth of the interface register.

**Text overlay:**
Line 1 (appears at 0:03): **"In most football games, scouting is a menu."**
Line 2 (appears at 0:05): **"This is the entire game."**

Text style: white, clean, centre-screen. No border. Fade in/fade out.

**Audio:**
Ambient match sounds begin building under. Crowd texture, distant whistle.

**Transition:**
Hard cut to Act 1.

---

## Act 1: The Fantasy — What Being a Scout Feels Like

---

### Beat 3 — The Weekly Plan

**Timestamp:** 0:08 – 0:14
**Duration:** 6 seconds

**Visuals:**
The Calendar screen. A week partially built: a live match slot filled, a video analysis session confirmed, two empty slots. The activity picker drawer is open on the right — visible categories, 37 activity types listed. Fatigue bar partially depleted from the planned activities.

**Text overlay:**
**"Plan your week."**
Small subtitle below: "37 activity types. Fatigue is real."

**Audio:**
Music enters — mid-tempo, instrumental, focused. Think post-rock or ambient electronic with a persistent underlying pulse. Not triumphant yet. Purposeful.

**Transition:**
Quick cut (6 frames) to Beat 4.

---

### Beat 4 — Attending a Match

**Timestamp:** 0:14 – 0:20
**Duration:** 6 seconds

**Visuals:**
The 2D pitch canvas during a live match observation. Player positions rendered as markers on the dark pitch. One player highlighted — observation lens focused on them. The observation context label reads "Live Match". A partially-filled confidence interval is visible on an attribute: for example, "Pace  14 ± 3".

**Text overlay:**
**"Watch. Form opinions."**

**Audio:**
Match atmosphere surges — crowd reacts to a moment of play. Ball strike SFX. Music continues underneath.

**Transition:**
Smash cut to Beat 5.

---

### Beat 5 — Writing the Report

**Timestamp:** 0:20 – 0:27
**Duration:** 7 seconds

**Visuals:**
The report writing screen. A player's procedural avatar visible in the top corner. Attribute readings with confidence ranges displayed — some tight, some wide, reflecting observation depth. The conviction selector is open and highlighted. The four levels are visible: **Note / Recommend / Strong Recommend / Table Pound**. The cursor is hovering on "Strong Recommend". Quality score indicator in the corner.

**Text overlay:**
**"Write your report."**
Then, after a half-beat: **"Every word carries your name."**

**Audio:**
Music drops slightly. A deliberate, slightly tense moment. Pen-on-paper SFX if available, or UI confirmation tone.

**Transition:**
Cut with a subtle flash to Beat 6.

---

### Beat 6 — The Table Pound

**Timestamp:** 0:27 – 0:30
**Duration:** 3 seconds

**Visuals:**
Close on the conviction selector. The cursor moves from "Strong Recommend" to **"Table Pound"**. It clicks. The report confirmation state fires — a celebration effect (confetti burst, reveal card animation). On-screen: the conviction badge now reads "TABLE POUND" in its styled treatment.

**Text overlay:**
**"Or stake everything."**

**Audio:**
A sharp, satisfying impact SFX. Music snaps back up in energy.

**Transition:**
Hard cut to Act 2. Music accelerates slightly.

---

## Act 2: The Depth

---

### Beat 7 — The World Map

**Timestamp:** 0:30 – 0:35
**Duration:** 5 seconds

**Visuals:**
The International screen. The world map displayed with two or three countries already scouted — familiarity scores visible (e.g., England: 72, Germany: 34). Unvisited territories in muted colour. The map communicates geographic breadth without needing text explanation.

**Text overlay:**
**"22 countries. 292 clubs."**
Small subtitle: "Every playthrough, different players."

**Audio:**
Music opens up slightly — a melodic lift. Sense of scale.

**Transition:**
Pan or dissolve to Beat 8.

---

### Beat 8 — Player Database with Avatars

**Timestamp:** 0:35 – 0:40
**Duration:** 5 seconds

**Visuals:**
The Players screen. Procedurally generated player avatars (SVG faces) with position badges, nationality flags, and procedural club crests visible in the list. A filter is active — e.g., "CAM / Age 18–22 / England". Two or three players have watchlist indicators. The list scrolls rapidly to imply depth.

**Text overlay:**
**"Thousands of players to find."**
Subtitle: "Most of them, nobody else is watching."

**Audio:**
Music continues. Light data-entry UI sounds as filters apply and results populate.

**Transition:**
Cut to Beat 9.

---

### Beat 9 — Hidden Attributes

**Timestamp:** 0:40 – 0:46
**Duration:** 6 seconds

**Visuals:**
Back to the match observation screen. A split moment: on one side, the visible attribute readings with confidence intervals. On the other side (or overlaid), the hidden attributes panel — "Consistency", "Big-game temperament", "Professionalism" — each showing as "???" or a locked indicator, not yet revealed. The contrast between known and unknown is the story.

**Text overlay:**
**"You can read pace. You can read passing."**
Then: **"Consistency? Big-game temperament? Those take time."**

**Audio:**
A brief moment of tension in the music — held note, quiet. Suggests uncertainty.

**Transition:**
Smash cut to Beat 10.

---

### Beat 10 — Four Specialization Paths

**Timestamp:** 0:46 – 0:55
**Duration:** 9 seconds

**Visuals:**
The Career/specialization screen showing the four perk trees. Rapid cross-cuts — one per path — each showing a different unlock mid-tree:

- **First Team Scout:** "Form vs Ability" perk. Description text briefly visible.
- **Youth Scout:** "Wonderkid Radar" perk. Generational alert visual if possible.
- **Data Scout:** "Anomaly Detection" perk. Statistical overlay on player data.
- **Regional Expert:** "Territory Mastery" perk. Country familiarity map highlighted.

Each cut is 2 seconds. Tight. Fast. The rhythm should feel like you're choosing your identity.

**Text overlay:**
Each cut gets one line:
- **"First Team Scout."**
- **"Youth Scout."**
- **"Data Scout."**
- **"Regional Expert."**
Final hold: **"29 perks. One path."**

**Audio:**
Music hits a rhythmic accent on each cut. Percussive. Builds into Act 3.

**Transition:**
Hard cut to Act 3. Music peaks.

---

## Act 3: The Stakes

---

### Beat 11 — The Discovery

**Timestamp:** 0:55 – 1:02
**Duration:** 7 seconds

**Visuals:**
A wonderkid discovery moment. The reveal card animation fires — confetti effect, procedural player avatar displayed large, achievement toast: "Diamond in the Rough — Discover a wonderkid." The player's wonderkid designation is visible. Reputation meter visibly jumps.

**Text overlay:**
**"You found him first."**

**Audio:**
Music swells. The big moment. String layer or melodic lead enters. This is the emotional payoff of the whole loop.

**Transition:**
Hold for half a beat, then smash cut to Beat 12.

---

### Beat 12 — The Promotion

**Timestamp:** 1:02 – 1:06
**Duration:** 4 seconds

**Visuals:**
Career tier promotion screen. The scout info panel in the sidebar showing the new tier — "Tier 3 Scout" or "Elite Scout — Tier 4". Perk tree panel open, new perks becoming available. Achievement toast: "Established — Reach Career Tier 3."

**Text overlay:**
**"Career built, week by week."**

**Audio:**
Music continues its upward trajectory. A satisfying unlock chime.

**Transition:**
Cut to Beat 13.

---

### Beat 13 — Getting It Wrong

**Timestamp:** 1:06 – 1:10
**Duration:** 4 seconds

**Visuals:**
A performance review screen showing a negative outcome — a warning, a reputation drop, or the fired state. The reputation bar visibly lower. An inbox message visible with a subject line implying the club is unhappy. If a "Comeback Kid" achievement is available to trigger, show it here.

**Text overlay:**
**"Get it wrong enough,"**
Then: **"and clubs stop listening."**

**Audio:**
Music drops to low, tense. Single held note. The contrast to the previous beat is intentional.

**Transition:**
Quick cut to Beat 14.

---

### Beat 14 — Scenarios as Hooks

**Timestamp:** 1:10 – 1:15
**Duration:** 5 seconds

**Visuals:**
The scenario browser. All 10 scenarios visible with difficulty badges. Rapid cuts — 2 seconds each — focused on two scenario cards:

1. **"Zero to Hero"** — "No club. No reputation. No contacts." Difficulty badge: Expert.
2. **"The Rescue Job"** — "8 weeks. Winter window. A relegation battle." Difficulty badge: Easy.

**Text overlay:**
**"10 scenarios."**
Subtitle: "From your first job to your last season."

**Audio:**
Music rebuilds from the low point. Energy returns.

**Transition:**
Cut to Closing. Music reaches its final peak.

---

## Closing

---

### Beat 15 — Stats Montage

**Timestamp:** 1:15 – 1:20
**Duration:** 5 seconds

**Visuals:**
A fast-cut montage — 1 second per shot — cycling through five screens:
1. World map, multiple countries lit.
2. Reports list, scrolling — 50+ entries.
3. Achievements screen — multiple unlocked.
4. Alumni dashboard — a youth placement who made their debut.
5. Match observation pitch canvas — observation lens on a player.

**Text overlay:**
Each cut gets one stat, rapid-fire:
- **"22 countries"**
- **"292 clubs"**
- **"45 achievements"**
- **"10 scenarios"**
- **"1 career"**

**Audio:**
Music at full energy. Each stat cut lands on a beat.

**Transition:**
Hold on the last shot for a half-beat, then cut to black.

---

### Beat 16 — Title Card

**Timestamp:** 1:20 – 1:28
**Duration:** 8 seconds

**Visuals:**
Black screen. The TalentScout wordmark fades in: "Talent**Scout**" — white text with the emerald "Scout" treatment, matching the in-game sidebar branding exactly.

Below the wordmark, after a short pause, the tagline appears.

**Text overlay:**
Wordmark: **TalentScout**
Tagline: **"You're not the manager. You're the scout."**
Below, after another pause: **"Wishlist on Steam"** with the Steam logo lockup.

**Audio:**
Music resolves to a clean, quiet ending. Single piano note or ambient pad. Not a crash — a close.

**Transition:**
Fade to black. Hold.

---

## Capture Setup List

Instructions for setting up specific game states before recording.

---

### Setup A — Mid-career Dashboard (Beat 2)

**Save state:** Tier 3 or 4 scout. At least Season 3. Reputation between 55–70.
**Screen:** Dashboard.
**Actions before capture:** Ensure at least one unread inbox message (badge visible) and at least one unreviewed NPC scout report. Have several nav items populated. Do not advance week before recording.
**Notes:** The goal is density — the sidebar should show most of the 19 nav items, all populated. Multiple active panels visible simultaneously.
**Resolution:** 1920×1080. Record at 60fps.

---

### Setup B — Weekly Calendar (Beat 3)

**Save state:** Any save where the calendar has room to plan a new week.
**Screen:** Calendar.
**Actions before capture:** Open the activity picker drawer. Add a live match to one slot. Add a video analysis session to a second slot. Leave two slots empty. Ensure fatigue bar is partially depleted (plan something mildly draining first if starting at zero).
**Notes:** The empty slots are intentional — they communicate a planning decision is happening, not a completed week.
**Resolution:** 1920×1080. 60fps.

---

### Setup C — Live Match Observation (Beats 4 and 9)

**Save state:** A week where a live match is scheduled. Preferably early-to-mid game so not all attributes are resolved.
**Screen:** Match observation / pitch canvas.
**Actions before capture:** Enter the match. Select a specific player to observe. Wait for at least one attribute to begin resolving — showing a reading like "Pace 14 ± 3". Do not over-observe before recording; the wide confidence interval is the story.
**Notes:** For Beat 9, the hidden attribute panel showing "???" is the key visual. Do not unlock Regional Expert "Hidden Attribute Revealer" perk before this capture.
**Resolution:** 1920×1080. 60fps.

---

### Setup D — Report Writing with Conviction Selector (Beats 5 and 6)

**Save state:** A save where a player has been observed 2–3 times. Enough observations for a meaningful report but not fully resolved attributes.
**Screen:** Report writing screen.
**Actions before capture:** Navigate to report writing for the observed player. Leave the conviction selector open and visible. For Beat 5, hover on "Strong Recommend". For Beat 6, click through to "Table Pound" on camera — let the celebration effect fire live.
**Notes:** Do not dismiss the confetti/reveal card before recording Beat 6. The live celebration firing during capture is preferable to a static screenshot.
**Resolution:** 1920×1080. 60fps.

---

### Setup E — World Map / International Screen (Beat 7)

**Save state:** A Tier 3+ save where the scout has worked in at least 3 countries.
**Screen:** International.
**Actions before capture:** Ensure familiarity scores are visible for at least two countries. Hover over one country to show the tooltip/detail state if available. Unvisited territories should be visible in contrast.
**Resolution:** 1920×1080. 60fps.

---

### Setup F — Player Database with Filters (Beat 8)

**Save state:** Any mid-game save with a populated player pool.
**Screen:** Players.
**Actions before capture:** Apply a filter — e.g., position CAM, age 18–22, nationality England. Ensure 2–3 players have watchlist indicators. The list should show procedural avatars and club crests clearly.
**Resolution:** 1920×1080. 60fps.

---

### Setup G — Specialization Perk Trees (Beat 10)

**Save state:** A save at Tier 3 or 4 with at least one specialization partially progressed (3–5 perks unlocked).
**Screen:** Career / specialization perk tree.
**Actions before capture:** Four separate captures, one per tree. For each, navigate to that tree and highlight one mid-tier perk. The descriptions should be partially readable on screen. Unlocked perks should have their visual treatment distinct from locked ones.
**Notes:** These four captures are edited together — plan each one individually. Label files clearly (firstteam, youth, data, regional).
**Resolution:** 1920×1080. 60fps each.

---

### Setup H — Wonderkid Discovery (Beat 11)

**Save state:** A save in the "Wonderkid Hunter" scenario, or any save where a wonderkid has been identified in the observation pool but not yet formally discovered.
**Screen:** The discovery fires during report filing or via the game-loop event — capture the reveal card / confetti celebration on camera.
**Actions before capture:** Navigate to the player. File a report. Allow the wonderkid discovery event to fire live. The "Diamond in the Rough" achievement toast is a bonus capture if it triggers simultaneously.
**Notes:** This is the hardest capture to stage — it requires genuine in-game state. Consider the Youth Scout path with the "Wonderkid Radar" perk for a higher trigger rate during capture sessions.
**Resolution:** 1920×1080. 60fps.

---

### Setup I — Scenario Browser (Beat 14)

**Save state:** From the main menu / new game flow — the scenario selection screen.
**Screen:** Scenario browser.
**Actions before capture:** Expand the objectives panel for "Zero to Hero" and "The Rescue Job" individually. Capture each card in a close-crop state showing name, difficulty badge, and description.
**Notes:** Both scenarios need separate captures. Zero to Hero card first, Rescue Job second, for editing order.
**Resolution:** 1920×1080. 60fps.

---

### Setup J — Title Card (Beat 16)

**Note:** This is a designed asset, not a game capture. Produce in post using the game's exact typography:
- Wordmark: weight matching sidebar `font-bold`, "Scout" in `text-emerald-500`.
- Background: `#0c0c0c` (matches the sidebar background color from `GameLayout.tsx`).
- Tagline: white, regular weight, smaller than the wordmark.
- Steam wordmark lockup: follow Steam's press kit guidelines for the logo treatment.

## Music Direction

**Overall arc:** The music should start sparse and atmospheric, build through the weekly loop sequence, hit a rhythmic groove during the specialization section, swell emotionally at the discovery beat, and close quietly. The arc mirrors the emotional journey: uncertainty, focus, depth, payoff, reflection.

**Opening (0:00 – 0:08):** Silence or near-silence. A single ambient element — distant crowd texture, a held pad. The contrast sets up the music that follows.

**Act 1 (0:08 – 0:30):** Focused, instrumental, mid-tempo. Think post-rock builds or ambient electronic with a steady pulse. Guitar or synth lead. Not triumphant — purposeful. Reference genre: cinematic indie electronic. Tempo: 90–110 BPM.

**Act 2 (0:30 – 0:55):** The groove deepens. Percussion enters. Rhythmic accents hit on each specialization cut (Beat 10). This is where the music should feel most propulsive — it carries the weight of game depth. Reference genre: modern electronic, subtle IDM influence.

**Act 3 (0:55 – 1:15):** Full emotional range. The discovery beat (0:55–1:02) should get the melodic peak — a string layer, a piano lead, or a synth melody that feels earned. The "getting it wrong" section (1:06–1:10) needs the music to drop back — held note, tension — before rebuilding for scenarios.

**Closing (1:15 – 1:28):** Stats montage continues the peak energy, then the title card resolves cleanly. End on a single sustained note or a gentle ambient close. Not a crash. The game is a slow burn — the ending should reflect that.

**Reference genres (avoid specific tracks due to licensing):**
- Cinematic post-rock (instrumental, builds with purpose)
- Ambient electronic / IDM (textural, rhythmically propulsive)
- Modern indie game OST (Hollow Knight, SOMA, Into the Breach as reference tone — not specific tracks)

**Key requirements:**
- 100% royalty-free or original composition. No sync license exposure.
- No lyrics. Lyrics compete with text overlays.
- Must be editable to fit exact cut points — request stems or loop-friendly version from composer.

---

## Text Style Guide

---

### Overlay Principles

Text overlays in the trailer serve two functions: framing the premise (Act 0 and closing), and labelling game systems (Acts 1–2). They should never describe what the viewer can already see. Every overlay adds context the image alone cannot carry.

---

### Typography

**Primary overlay font:**
A clean, geometric sans-serif. Must feel modern and precise — it is a simulation game for football professionals. Suggested options from free/open-source:
- **Inter** (weight: 600 SemiBold for emphasis, 400 Regular for subtitles) — matches the game's UI aesthetic
- **DM Sans** as an alternative

Avoid: serif fonts, display fonts with personality flourishes, anything that reads as handwritten or vintage.

**Wordmark / title card:**
Match the in-game rendering exactly: "Talent" in white, "Scout" in emerald (#10b981 — Tailwind `emerald-500`). Bold weight.

---

### Color Palette

| Role | Color | Hex |
|------|-------|-----|
| Primary overlay text | White | #ffffff |
| Subtitle / secondary text | Zinc muted | #a1a1aa |
| Emphasis / game terms | Emerald | #10b981 |
| Background (title card) | Near-black | #0c0c0c |
| Conviction badge (Table Pound) | Amber or red — match in-game treatment | TBD from game UI |

**Rules:**
- Never place white text on a light background — all overlays assume a dark game UI behind them.
- Use emerald sparingly. Reserve it for proper nouns ("Table Pound", "Wonderkid", specialization names) and the wordmark.
- No drop shadows on text. If legibility is an issue, add a subtle semi-transparent underlay (#000000 at 40% opacity, 8px blur).

---

### Animation Style

**Fade in / fade out:** Default for all informational overlays. Duration: 200ms in, 150ms out.

**Hard appear / hard disappear:** Use for the rapid-fire stat montage (Beat 15) and specialization name cuts (Beat 10). Each label appears and disappears on the music beat.

**Slide in from bottom:** Optional for subtitle text that follows a headline. Subtle — 8px travel, 150ms ease-out.

**Never use:** Typewriter effects (too slow, wrong tone), word-by-word reveals, comic-style whoosh transitions. The game is a simulation, not an action title.

---

### Text Overlay Rules

- **Max two lines per beat.** If a third line is needed, split it across two beats.
- **Headline line:** Short, direct, no punctuation unless it is a comma for rhythm or a period for finality. Maximum 8 words.
- **Subtitle line:** One sentence. Maximum 10 words. Set smaller (60–70% of headline size).
- **Do not use exclamation marks.** The game's tone is confident, not excited. Let the visuals carry the energy.
- **Game terms in the overlays should match in-game terminology exactly:** "Table Pound" not "Table pound" or "TABLE POUND" (except in the styled badge). "Wonderkid" not "wonder kid" or "wunderkid". "Tier 1" through "Tier 5", not "Level 1".

---

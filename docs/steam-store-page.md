## 2. About This Game

*(Long description — Steam HTML formatting)*

```html
In most football games, scouting is a menu you open between transfers. In TalentScout, it's the entire game.<br>
<br>
You play as a scout — not the manager, not the sporting director. Your job is to watch players, form opinions about them, and commit those opinions to paper. Every report you file carries a conviction level, from a quiet <strong>note</strong> to a full <strong>table pound</strong> where you stake your professional reputation on a single player. Get it right and your career rises. Get it wrong often enough and clubs stop listening.
<br><br>
<h2>A career you build week by week</h2>
The game runs on a weekly calendar. Each week you plan a schedule — live matches, video analysis sessions, network meetings, training ground visits, rest — then advance time and deal with what unfolds. Your observations build up across multiple viewings of the same player, narrowing the confidence interval around their true attributes. You are never certain. You learn to work with what you have.<br>
<br>
Career progression spans five tiers, from an unpaid <strong>Freelance Scout</strong> with no contacts and no budget, up to <strong>Head of Scouting</strong>, where you manage a team of NPC scouts, review their reports, and set the agenda for an entire department. Promotion comes from reputation, and reputation comes from the quality and accuracy of your work.
<br><br>
<h2>Four ways to specialise</h2>
As you progress, you invest in one of four specialization paths — each with its own perk tree and play style:
<ul>
<li><strong>First Team Scout</strong> — read form versus underlying ability, assess tactical system fit, and build the boardroom influence to make clubs follow your recommendations.</li>
<li><strong>Youth Scout</strong> — unlock grassroots venues, develop an instinct for raw potential, and track the development of youngsters you placed years earlier.</li>
<li><strong>Data Scout</strong> — layer per-90 statistical benchmarks over your observations, detect anomalies the eye misses, and build predictive models from historical patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Regional Expert</strong> — build deep familiarity with specific countries, earn intelligence from a contact network that trusts you, and become the definitive authority on your territory.</li>
</ul>
Each tree has 7–8 perks, culminating in mastery-tier abilities that fundamentally change how you play.
<br><br>
<h2>A procedural world with genuine depth</h2>
The game world contains 292 clubs spread across real leagues in 22 countries. Players are procedurally generated with position-specific attributes across technical, physical, mental, tactical, and hidden domains. Hidden attributes — consistency, big-game temperament, injury proneness, professionalism — are never directly visible. You infer them over time through observation, contact tips, and gut feeling. Personality traits add another layer: a player might be a pressure player or a late developer, and those facts matter to the report you write about them.<br>
<br>
With 10 scenarios, 45 achievements, and a multi-season legacy system that tracks your career beyond its final week, TalentScout is built for the football obsessive who has always wanted to know what the other side of the dugout looks like.

## 3. Key Features

*(For the key features section of the store page — use Steam's bullet format)*

- **Four specialization paths.** Choose between First Team Scout, Youth Scout, Data Scout, and Regional Expert. Each path has its own perk tree, unique mechanics, and a distinct way of reading the game.

- **29 perks across four trees.** Unlock abilities that change what you can see, what you can infer, and how much weight your recommendations carry in the boardroom — including mastery-tier perks like Wonderkid Radar, Transfer Kingmaker, and Neural Scout Network.

- **10 scenarios, from easy to expert.** Take on The Rescue Job (8 weeks, winter window, a relegation battle), Wonderkid Hunter (find three generational talents in one season), or Zero to Hero (start with nothing and climb from Tier 1 to Tier 3 in three seasons). Each scenario has required objectives and optional bonus goals.

- **Five career tiers.** Progress from Freelance Scout with no club affiliation up through full-time contracted roles to Head of Scouting, where you manage a department of NPC scouts and review their reports.

- **22 countries with familiarity systems.** Every country you scout in has its own familiarity score. Work a territory long enough and your Regional Expert perks stack with local knowledge to make your observations the most accurate in that market.

- **292 procedurally-placed clubs.** The game world spans real leagues across 22 countries. Every playthrough distributes players differently, so no two careers look the same.

- **Weekly planning and fatigue.** Plan your seven-day schedule from 37 available activity types — live matches, video sessions, academy visits, network meetings, grassroots scouting, rest, and more. Fatigue degrades observation accuracy; endurance management is a real constraint.

- **Observation and attribute inference.** Players have technical, physical, mental, tactical, and hidden attributes, none of which you read directly. Each match viewing narrows your confidence interval. Hidden attributes — consistency, big-game temperament, professionalism — require repeated observation or reliable contact tips to surface.

- **Four conviction levels.** Every report you file carries a conviction: note, recommend, strong recommend, or table pound. Table pounding stakes your professional reputation. It raises the stakes on your career in a meaningful way.

- **Player personality traits.** Players carry 2–4 hidden personality traits — ambitious, temperamental, big game player, late developer, and more — that you uncover through sustained observation. They influence the quality of the report you can write.

- **NPC scout management.** Unlock at Tier 4. Assign NPC scouts to fixtures, review the reports they file, and decide which recommendations to escalate. Managing the output of a department is a different skill from generating it yourself.

- **Youth scouting and alumni tracking.** Discover unsigned youth, write placement reports, and then watch what happens to the players you placed. Alumni who go on to earn professional debuts or international call-ups contribute to your legacy score.

- **Multi-season legacy system.** Your career is scored beyond individual seasons. Discovery records, alumni milestones, and report quality all feed into a legacy total that determines your Hall of Fame standing when you retire.

- **45 achievements.** Spanning career milestones, scouting excellence, specialization mastery, world exploration, and five hidden achievements that reward unconventional play.

- **Rival scouts with their own agendas.** NPC scouts compete for the same players. In Rivalry scenarios, a named nemesis applies real pressure. At higher tiers, understanding who else is watching a player becomes part of the decision.

## 5. Screenshot Descriptions

Eight specific screenshots to capture for the Steam store. Listed in recommended display order.

---

**Screenshot 1 — Dashboard overview**

Show the main dashboard mid-career (Tier 3 or 4). The sidebar should be fully populated with all unlocked nav items. Highlight the reputation progress bar, current week/season indicator, and at least one visible inbox notification badge. Aim for a state where multiple panels are active — recent reports, upcoming fixtures, and a career summary — to communicate game breadth at a glance.

---

**Screenshot 2 — Match observation with pitch canvas**

Capture the live match observation screen during an active fixture. The pitch canvas should show player positions and at least one observation lens focused on a specific player. If possible, show a partially-filled confidence interval on an attribute (e.g., pace at 14±3) alongside the observation context label ("Live Match"). This is the most mechanically distinctive screen in the game — make it clear this is not a passive view.

---

**Screenshot 3 — Report writing**

Show a report in progress for a specific player. The conviction selector should be visible (showing the four levels: note, recommend, strong recommend, table pound). Include at least one observation-backed attribute reading with a confidence range, and the player's revealed personality traits panel. The qualityScore indicator should be visible. This communicates the depth of the output the player produces.

---

**Screenshot 4 — Player database with avatars and crests**

Capture the Players screen with a list of players showing position badges, nationality flags, and club crests. Apply a filter (e.g., "CAM, age 18–22, England") to show the search/filter system in action. If watchlist indicators are available, show at least two watchlisted players in the list. Communicates the breadth of the player pool and the filtering depth.

---

**Screenshot 5 — World map on International screen**

Show the International screen with the world map visible. Highlight two or three countries the scout has already worked in (with familiarity scores shown), contrasted with unvisited territories. If country-specific reputation figures are visible on hover, capture that state. Communicates the geographic scope of the game without requiring text explanation.

---

**Screenshot 6 — Scenario selection**

Capture the scenario browser showing all 10 scenarios. Show the difficulty badges (easy / medium / hard / expert), the estimated season length, and the objectives panel expanded for one scenario — ideally Wonderkid Hunter or Zero to Hero, as they have the clearest one-sentence hook. This is a high-value screenshot for communicating replay value.

---

**Screenshot 7 — Career progression / tier promotion**

Show the Career screen at a moment of tier promotion — the confirmation or summary state after reaching a new tier. Include the perk tree panel open to show the next perks available to unlock. If a specialization path selector is visible (early game), capture that instead to show the four-path choice. The goal is to show progression in a single frame.

---

**Screenshot 8 — Calendar / weekly planner**

Show the Calendar screen with a week partially planned. Some slots should be filled (e.g., live match, video session, network meeting) and some empty, to communicate the planning decision. The activity picker/drawer should ideally be open alongside, showing the 37 available activity types grouped by category. Fatigue indicators should be visible if possible. This is the screen players spend the most time on — it should look meaningful and legible.

## 6. Steam Tags

Recommended tags in priority order (Steam allows up to 20):

```
Sports
Simulation
Management
Strategy
Singleplayer
Indie
Football
Soccer
Career
Tactical
Text-Based
Procedural Generation
Multiple Endings
Choices Matter
Replay Value
Atmospheric
Dark
```

**Notes on tag choices:**

- "Football" and "Soccer" both used deliberately — Steam's audience is international and search behavior splits along those terms.
- "Text-Based" applies accurately: the game's primary interface is data, reports, and menus rather than 3D graphics.
- "Multiple Endings" is defensible given the 10 scenarios and legacy scoring outcomes.
- "Dark" fits the UI aesthetic (dark zinc/emerald color scheme) and may capture players browsing by visual tone.
- Avoid "RPG" — the perk system is present but the game's identity is simulation, not role-playing.

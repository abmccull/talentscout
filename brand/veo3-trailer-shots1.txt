## VISUAL BIBLE — Read This First

Every Veo 3 prompt references this locked description. Copy-paste the relevant
sections into each prompt to maintain consistency across clips.

### The Scout (appears in shots 1, 2, 4a/b/c, 5, 9)

```
A man in his late 40s, weathered face, short grey-flecked dark hair, clean-shaven.
He wears a dark navy wool overcoat over a charcoal sweater, dark trousers, and
worn brown leather shoes. He carries a small leather-bound notebook and a red pen.
He is lean, average height, quiet posture — not athletic, not imposing. He looks
like someone who watches for a living. His face is never fully lit — always partial
shadow, side-lit, or silhouetted. We see his profile, his back, his hands — never
a clean front-facing close-up.
```

### The Pitch (appears in shots 1, 2, 3, 9)

```
A small South American youth football ground at night. Concrete terraces with no
seats — just stepped concrete. No dugouts. Two tall floodlight poles with warm
amber tungsten bulbs, not modern white LED. The pitch is natural grass, worn and
slightly muddy. White line markings are faded. A chain-link fence runs along one
side. The sky is deep blue-black, overcast, no stars. Heavy rain is falling
steadily. The floodlights create visible amber light shafts through the rain.
Puddles reflect the amber light on the concrete. This is not a professional
stadium — it is a modest local ground that holds maybe 500 people.
```

### The Young Player (appears in shots 2, 3)

```
A teenage male footballer, approximately 16 years old, slim athletic build, dark
hair, wearing a plain dark navy jersey with no visible logos, dark shorts, dark
socks. He is always seen from behind, from the side, or at a distance — his face
is never clearly visible. He moves with calm intelligence, not flashy speed.
```

### Color & Grade (apply to ALL Veo 3 shots)

```
Cinematic color grading: deep navy-black shadows (#0A1628), warm amber-tungsten
highlights (#D4A843), desaturated muted green for grass (#2D5A3D). Heavy film
grain. Anamorphic widescreen look with subtle horizontal lens flares from light
sources. Contrast is high — deep blacks, limited midtones, warm highlights only
where light falls. The overall feeling is a 35mm film shot in available light
at night.
```

### Audio Rule (CRITICAL — apply to ALL Veo 3 shots)

```
AUDIO: Ambient environmental sound only. Sound of steady rain hitting concrete
and metal. Distant muffled crowd murmur. No dialogue. No voiceover. No narration.
No one speaks. No music. No soundtrack.
```

### Universal Negative Prompts (include with every generation)

```
No text on screen. No titles. No graphics. No UI overlays. No watermarks. No
subtitles. No logos on jerseys or buildings. No modern LED floodlights — only
warm amber tungsten. No bright saturated colors. No daylight. No sunshine. No
one looks directly at the camera. No one speaks or mouths words.
```

## Shot 1 / 10 — COLD OPEN (0:00–0:08)

**VO (added in post):** "Rain in Rosario. A youth cup semifinal. Nobody's watching."

**Veo 3 prompt:**
```
A slow cinematic dolly forward toward a youth football pitch at night, viewed
through a chain-link fence. The camera starts tight on the diamond pattern of the
fence with the pitch blurred behind it, then slowly racks focus to reveal the
pitch as the camera drifts forward. Heavy steady rain falls through two tall
amber tungsten floodlight beams, creating visible golden light shafts. The pitch
is natural grass, slightly muddy, with faded white line markings. About thirty
to forty people stand scattered along the far touchline — small dark figures, no
umbrellas, just watching in the rain. Two coaches in dark rain jackets stand at
the edge of the pitch. No dugouts. Concrete stepped terraces on both sides, mostly
empty. A youth football match is in progress — teenage players in dark jerseys
move in the middle distance, but they are not the focus. The focus is the
atmosphere: the rain, the amber light, the emptiness, the isolation of this
small ground at night. Deep blue-black sky, overcast. Puddles on the concrete
reflect amber light. Shot on 35mm anamorphic lens, heavy film grain, shallow
depth of field transitioning to deep focus. The camera movement is slow and
steady — no handheld shake. Color: deep navy blacks, warm amber tungsten
highlights, desaturated muted green grass.

AUDIO: Steady rain on metal and concrete. Distant muffled crowd murmur. A
referee whistle in the far distance. No dialogue. No voiceover. No music.
No one speaks.

No text on screen. No titles. No logos. No modern LED lights.
```

**Camera:** Slow dolly forward, rack focus from fence to pitch
**Duration:** 8 seconds

---

## Shot 2 / 10 — THE NOTEBOOK (0:08–0:16)

**VO (added in post):** "Except you." *(2-sec beat of silence)* "A left-footed centre-back. Sixteen years old."

**Veo 3 prompt:**
```
Extreme close-up of a man's hands holding open a small leather-bound notebook in
the rain at night. The hands belong to a man in his late 40s — weathered skin,
no rings, short clean nails. He holds a red pen in his right hand. The notebook
page is filled with small handwritten notes — abbreviations, arrows, a circled
word. Raindrops land on the open page, wetting the edges. The man slowly and
deliberately underlines a word on the page with the red pen, pressing firmly.
The camera holds tight on the notebook for four seconds, then begins a slow
tilt upward — past the man's dark navy wool overcoat sleeve, past his chest,
continuing up and over his shoulder to reveal a rain-soaked youth football pitch
in the background, out of focus with warm amber floodlight bokeh. Small dark
figures of teenage players move on the pitch in the soft background blur. The
man never turns around — we see only the back of his head and his grey-flecked
dark hair. Rain continues falling through the amber light. The camera completes
its tilt with the pitch filling the upper frame and the notebook filling the
lower frame. Shot on 35mm anamorphic lens, heavy film grain. Shallow depth of
field — the notebook is razor sharp, everything beyond the man's hands is soft
bokeh.

AUDIO: Close-up sound of rain hitting paper and leather. The scratch of pen on
paper. Distant muffled crowd in the background. No dialogue. No voiceover. No
music. No one speaks.

No text on screen. No titles. No graphics. No readable words on the notebook
page — just the impression of handwriting.
```

**Camera:** Static close-up, slow tilt up over shoulder
**Duration:** 8 seconds

---

## Shot 3 / 10 — THE PLAYER (0:16–0:24)

**VO (added in post):** "Reads the game two seconds ahead of everyone on that pitch."

**Veo 3 prompt:**
```
Slow motion cinematic shot of a teenage male footballer, approximately 16 years
old, slim athletic build, dark hair, wearing a plain dark navy jersey, dark
shorts, dark socks. He stands on a rain-soaked grass pitch at night under warm
amber tungsten floodlights. The camera is at his waist height, positioned to
his left side, slowly tracking alongside him. He is looking away from camera,
scanning the pitch — his head turns smoothly from left to right, reading the
space ahead of him. His body language is calm and composed. A football rolls
toward him from off-screen right. Without looking down at the ball, he receives
it with his left foot and in one fluid motion plays a long diagonal pass forward
with his left foot. The pass leaves frame. He continues scanning the pitch after
the pass, already thinking about the next movement. Rain falls steadily through
the amber floodlight beams behind him, creating golden light shafts. Other
players are blurred dark shapes moving in the background. His face is mostly in
shadow — we see his profile and jawline but not a clear frontal view. The slow
motion makes the rain droplets hang in the amber light around him. Shot on 35mm
anamorphic lens, heavy film grain. Horizontal lens flare from the floodlight
behind him. Deep navy-black shadows, warm amber highlights on his shoulders
and the rain.

AUDIO: Muffled slow-motion ambient sound. The thud of a football being kicked.
Rain in slow motion — deep, low-frequency patter. No dialogue. No voiceover.
No music. No one speaks.

No text on screen. No titles. No logos on the jersey. His face is never fully
visible — always side-lit or in shadow.
```

**Camera:** Low angle, slow lateral track, slow motion
**Duration:** 8 seconds

---

## Shot 4A / 10 — THE JOURNEY: SOUTH AMERICA (0:24–0:28)

**VO (added in post, across 4A+4B+4C):** "Everyone talks about the manager. The tactics. The transfers. The trophies."

**NOTE:** The original script calls for a 3-location montage. Veo 3 cannot do
cuts or dissolves within a single clip. Generate THREE separate 4-second clips
(4A, 4B, 4C) and cut between them in post. Use 4A+4B together for this 8-second
window. 4C opens the next window.

**Veo 3 prompt:**
```
A lone man in his late 40s walks through a rusted metal turnstile into a small
open-air South American football ground during golden hour. He wears a dark navy
wool overcoat over a charcoal sweater, dark trousers, and carries a small
leather-bound notebook in his left hand. The camera is positioned inside the
ground, facing the turnstile, so we see him enter toward us. The ground has
open concrete terraces with faded painted walls in pale blue and white. Warm
golden sunlight comes from a low angle behind him, casting a long shadow. The
terraces are nearly empty — maybe a dozen people scattered around. A grass
pitch is visible behind the camera's position, out of focus. Dust motes float
in the golden light. The man walks with purpose, alone, looking toward the
pitch. His face is side-lit by the setting sun — profile visible but not a
front-on portrait. The mood is warm but solitary. Shot on 35mm anamorphic lens,
heavy film grain. Color: warm golden amber light, faded concrete blues and
whites, deep shadows in the turnstile area.

AUDIO: Distant Latin American crowd chatter. Metal turnstile clicking. Footsteps
on concrete. No dialogue. No voiceover. No music. No one speaks.

No text on screen. No titles. No logos. No modern elements.
```

**Camera:** Static medium shot, man walks toward camera
**Duration:** 4 seconds (trim in post)

---

## Shot 4B / 10 — THE JOURNEY: ENGLAND (0:28–0:32)

**Veo 3 prompt:**
```
A lone man in his late 40s sits alone in metal stadium seats at a cold, grey
English non-league football ground during a daytime match. He wears a dark navy
wool overcoat over a charcoal sweater, collar turned up against the cold. His
breath is visible in the cold air. He holds a small leather-bound notebook open
on his knee and watches the pitch intently. The camera is positioned three rows
behind him and slightly to the right, looking past his shoulder toward the pitch.
The stands are almost entirely empty — six or seven other spectators are scattered
far apart, bundled in coats and scarves. The sky is flat overcast grey. The pitch
below is muddy and worn. A simple metal railing runs along the front of the stand.
No fancy stadium — this is a ground that holds a few hundred people. The man is
still, focused, writing something in his notebook without looking down. Shot on
35mm anamorphic lens, heavy film grain. Color: cold desaturated grey-blue overall,
the man's dark navy coat is the darkest element, no warm tones — this is cold
English football.

AUDIO: Cold wind. Sparse distant shouts from the pitch. A football being kicked.
No dialogue. No voiceover. No music. No one speaks.

No text on screen. No titles. No logos. No modern LED advertising boards.
```

**Camera:** Static over-the-shoulder from behind, slightly elevated
**Duration:** 4 seconds (trim in post)

---

## Shot 4C / 10 — THE JOURNEY: ACADEMY (0:32–0:36)

**Veo 3 prompt:**
```
A lone man in his late 40s walks down a long modern football academy corridor.
He wears a dark navy wool overcoat over a charcoal sweater, carrying a small
leather-bound notebook. The corridor has floor-to-ceiling glass walls on the
right side, revealing perfectly manicured green training pitches outside under
grey sky. The interior is clean, modern — polished concrete floor, minimal
design, recessed lighting. The camera tracks alongside him from the left at
walking pace, a medium shot from the waist up. He looks through the glass at
the training pitches as he walks, observing. His reflection is faintly visible
in the glass. He is the only person in the corridor. Through the glass, small
figures of players train in the distance on the pitch outside. The contrast is
the point: this is sterile, corporate, institutional — the opposite of the
rainy pitches. The man looks slightly out of place in this sleek environment.
Shot on 35mm anamorphic lens, heavy film grain. Color: cool neutral tones inside,
desaturated green through the glass, soft diffused light from the overcast sky
outside.

AUDIO: Footsteps on polished concrete echoing in the corridor. Muffled sounds
of training — distant shouts, ball kicks — coming through the glass. No dialogue.
No voiceover. No music. No one speaks.

No text on screen. No titles. No logos. No brand names visible on walls.
```

**Camera:** Lateral tracking shot, walking pace, medium shot
**Duration:** 4 seconds (trim in post)

---

## Shot 5 / 10 — THE INVISIBLE MAN (0:36–0:44)

**VO (added in post):** "Nobody talks about the person who found him."

**Veo 3 prompt:**
```
Interior of a parked car on a grey overcast day. The camera is mounted on the
outside of the windshield looking in through the glass. A man in his late 40s
sits in the driver's seat. He wears a dark navy wool overcoat. He is a dark
silhouette against the grey light coming through the rear window. He holds a
folded newspaper in both hands, reading it — we can see the large format of
the paper but cannot read any text on it. The camera slowly pulls backward,
away from the windshield, revealing more of the car exterior and the setting:
the car is parked alone in an empty grey car park outside a football training
ground. In the background beyond the car, a chain-link fence and tall
floodlight poles are visible. The car park is wet — it has recently rained.
The sky is flat grey. No other cars. No other people. The man is completely
alone. As the camera pulls back, rain begins to lightly fall on the windshield,
distorting the view of the man inside. He becomes a blurred dark shape behind
the rain-streaked glass. Shot on 35mm anamorphic lens, heavy film grain. Color:
cold desaturated grey-blue, muted, the darkest element is the man's silhouette.
No warm tones in this shot — it is deliberately cold and lonely.

AUDIO: Light rain beginning to fall on glass and metal. A car engine ticking
as it cools. Distant traffic. No dialogue. No voiceover. No music. No one
speaks.

No text on screen. No titles. No readable text on the newspaper — it is just
a folded broadsheet shape. No logos on the car.
```

**Camera:** Slow pull-back from windshield exterior
**Duration:** 8 seconds

---

## Shot 6 / 10 — GAME REVEAL (0:44–0:52)

**VO (added in post):** "TalentScout. You're not the manager. You don't pick the team. You don't set tactics."

**GAME FOOTAGE — not Veo 3.**

Screen-capture sequence from the game build (2 sec per cut):
1. Scouting report screen filling in — transition from the newspaper in Shot 5
2. Career selection screen — four specialization paths visible
3. World map with scouting assignment pins across countries
4. Calendar view populating with upcoming fixtures

**Edit note:** Crossfade from Shot 5's rain-blurred windshield into the game UI.
The blurred silhouette dissolves into a scouting report on a dark screen. The
"real world" becomes the game world.

---

## Shot 7 / 10 — GAME SCOPE (0:52–1:00)

**VO (added in post):** "You're the reason the manager has anyone worth picking."

**GAME FOOTAGE — not Veo 3.**

Rapid gameplay montage (1.5 sec per cut):
- Player profile with attribute estimates and uncertainty ranges
- Shortlist screen with multiple player cards
- Rival scout notification — "Manchester City's scout attended the same match"
- Reputation meter visibly climbing
- Youth tournament bracket view

**Edit note:** Cuts are faster here. Music is building. Energy rises.

---

## Shot 8 / 10 — CAREER ARC (1:00–1:08)

**VO (added in post):** "Start at the bottom. Non-league pitches. Youth tournaments nobody filmed. Prove yourself one report at a time."

**GAME FOOTAGE — not Veo 3.**

Career progression montage (1.5 sec per cut):
- Early career: small match, basic report submitted
- Feedback notification: "Good eye — the club signed him"
- Data dashboard with statistical filters
- Network map of contacts — agents, coaches, journalists
- News headline: a player you scouted making a first-team debut
- Career tier advancing from Tier 1 to Tier 3

**Edit note:** Visual progression — screens get more complex, grounds get bigger,
stakes get higher as the montage advances.

---

## Shot 9A / 10 — THE CLOSE pt.1 (1:08–1:16)

**VO (added in post):** "Twenty-two countries. Three hundred and fifty clubs. Thousands of players who could be the next big thing. Or they could be nothing."

**Veo 3 prompt:**
```
Cinematic wide shot of a lone man sitting in empty concrete football terraces at
night in the rain. This is the same small South American youth ground from Shot 1:
concrete stepped terraces with no seats, two tall amber tungsten floodlight poles,
chain-link fence along one side, natural grass pitch. The match is over — the
pitch is empty, no players, no ball. The man sits alone in the middle of the
empty terrace, small in the wide frame. He wears a dark navy wool overcoat,
collar turned up. He holds a closed leather-bound notebook on his knee. Heavy
rain falls steadily through the amber floodlight beams. The concrete around him
is wet and reflective. The camera is positioned at a distance — a wide static
shot that emphasizes how alone and small he is in the empty ground. He is still
for four seconds, then slowly closes the notebook, tucks it inside his coat,
and stands up. He begins walking to the right, toward a dark exit tunnel at the
end of the terrace. The camera does not follow — it holds static. He walks away
and gets smaller in the frame. Shot on 35mm anamorphic lens, heavy film grain.
Color: deep navy-black shadows, warm amber floodlight pools on the wet concrete,
the man is a dark silhouette against the amber-lit pitch behind him.

AUDIO: Heavy rain on concrete. Dripping water. A distant metal gate creaking.
Complete silence otherwise — no crowd, no players, the match is over. No
dialogue. No voiceover. No music. No one speaks.

No text on screen. No titles. No logos. The man's face is not visible — he is
a silhouette and a dark shape at distance.
```

**Camera:** Wide static shot, no camera movement
**Duration:** 8 seconds

---

## Shot 9B / 10 — THE CLOSE pt.2 (1:16–1:20)

**VO (added in post):** *(quiet, almost to himself)* "That's the job. Knowing the difference."

**Veo 3 prompt:**
```
Continuation of the previous shot. The same small South American youth football
ground at night in the rain. Same amber tungsten floodlights, same concrete
terraces, same empty pitch. The man has now walked away — he is gone. The camera
holds on the exact same wide static frame. In the center of the empty terrace
where the man was sitting, there is now just an empty space — wet concrete, a
small puddle where he sat. The pitch glows amber-green behind the terraces under
the floodlights. Rain continues falling through the light beams. The ground is
completely deserted. No people anywhere. Just the empty terraces, the empty
pitch, the rain, and the amber light. The camera holds perfectly still for the
full duration. The composition emphasizes the absence — where the man was, now
there is nothing. Shot on 35mm anamorphic lens, heavy film grain. Shallow focus
slowly shifts from the empty terrace seat area to the pitch behind it during
the shot. Color: deep navy-black, warm amber pools, wet reflective surfaces.

AUDIO: Rain on concrete, slowly fading quieter. A distant metal door closing
with a dull clang. Then just rain. No dialogue. No voiceover. No music.
No one speaks.

No text on screen. No titles. No logos.
```

**Camera:** Wide static hold, slow rack focus to pitch
**Duration:** 4 seconds

---

## Shot 10 / 10 — TAG (1:20–1:28)

**Motion graphics — not Veo 3.**

Create in After Effects, CapCut, or Canva:

- 0:00 — Fade to black from Shot 9B (1 sec)
- 0:01 — Title fades in center screen:
  **TALENTSCOUT**
  (Condensed bold sans-serif, all-caps, #F0EBE3 on #0A1628, tight letter-spacing)
- 0:02 — Tagline fades in below title:
  *Every club needs a manager. But someone had to find Messi first.*
  (#8A9BAE, regular weight, sentence case)
- 0:05 — Steam logo fades in below: "Available in Early Access"
- 0:06 — Small text fades in at bottom: **You spotted him first.**
- 0:08 — Fade to black

**Veo 3 clips to generate:** 9 clips (6 full 8-sec, 3 short 4-sec)
**Total assembled runtime:** ~84 seconds

---

## Veo 3 Generation Strategy

### Consistency Across Clips

The biggest risk is visual inconsistency between clips. To minimize rework:

1. **Generate Shot 1 first.** This establishes the look — the rain, the floodlight
   color, the film grain, the overall grade. If Shot 1 looks right, use it as the
   style reference for all subsequent night shots.

2. **Night shots group** (1, 2, 3, 9A, 9B): These all share the same location,
   same rain, same floodlights. Generate them in sequence and describe them as
   the same location every time. Include "same small South American youth football
   ground" in every prompt.

3. **Journey shots group** (4A, 4B, 4C): Different locations but same character.
   Include the full scout character description in each. These are the hardest for
   consistency — if the man looks different across the three, try generating 4B
   (English ground) as the anchor and matching 4A and 4C to it.

4. **Shot 5** (car) is isolated — consistency with the scout's coat and build is
   the main concern. Since he's a silhouette, it's more forgiving.

### Per-Shot Generation Tips

| Shot | Likely Issues | Mitigation |
|------|--------------|------------|
| 1 | Floodlights might render as modern white LED | Emphasize "amber tungsten" and "warm golden" in prompt |
| 2 | Notebook text might generate readable gibberish | Specify "impression of handwriting, not readable text" |
| 3 | Player's face might be too visible | Emphasize "side-lit, profile only, face in shadow" |
| 4A | Man might not match across 4A/4B/4C | Lock the outfit description, generate from same session |
| 4B | English ground might look too modern | Specify "non-league, metal stands, no advertising boards" |
| 4C | Corridor might look like an office, not academy | Specify "training pitches visible through glass" |
| 5 | Newspaper text will be AI gibberish | Specify "no readable text, just folded broadsheet shape" |
| 9A | Man might do too much in 8 seconds | Keep action minimal: sit still 4 sec, then stand and walk |
| 9B | Empty shot might feel dead/boring | The slow rack focus gives it visual interest |

### Audio in Veo 3

Veo 3 generates audio by default. The prompts specify ambient sound only.
In post-production, you will likely:
- Keep the rain/ambient audio from Veo 3 as a foundation layer
- Layer in additional designed rain, crowd, and atmosphere SFX
- Add the voiceover track on top
- Add the music bed underneath everything

If Veo 3's generated audio sounds wrong (too clean, wrong reverb, unwanted
sounds), mute it entirely and rebuild from scratch with sound design.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

---

## Email 1: Announcement — "We built the game FM never gave us"

**Send timing:** Day -14 (two weeks before launch), Tuesday at 7:00 PM local
**Rationale:** Two weeks gives enough runway to build anticipation across the remaining emails. Tuesday evening catches the audience in leisure mode -- post-work, scrolling, thinking about games.

---

### Subject Line Variants

#### A: "We built the game FM never gave us" -- recommended
Safe bet: Speaks directly to the FM community's shared frustration. "FM" in the subject line is an instant signal that this email is relevant to them. Clear, specific, positions against the familiar.

**Preview text:** "Every football game lets you manage. None let you scout."

#### B: "You were never supposed to be the manager"
Bold play: Flips the assumption. Provocative framing that challenges the reader's identity as a virtual manager. Pattern interrupt that makes them think "wait, what?"

**Preview text:** "There's a game about the other role now."

#### C: "the scouting game we always wanted"
Personal touch: Lowercase, casual, peer-to-peer. Feels like a message from someone in the same Discord server, not a marketing email.

**Preview text:** "We got tired of waiting for someone to make it."

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests whether the audience responds more to direct FM community signaling or to identity-challenging provocation. Reveals whether they want to feel seen or want to be surprised.

---

### Email Copy

Hey,

Quick question. How many hours have you spent in Football Manager's scouting screen?

Sending scouts to South America. Waiting weeks for reports. Scrolling through pages of wonderkids, trying to find the one everyone else missed.

Now another question. Did it ever feel like enough?

We spent years doing the same thing. Youth intake day was Christmas. We had spreadsheets of Brazilian second-division kids we'd been tracking across saves. We watched U-17 highlights for fun.

And every time, we hit the same wall: scouting in FM is a sub-menu. A feature. A thing you do between setting tactics and managing the transfer budget.

We didn't want to manage. We wanted to scout.

So we built the game.

**TalentScout** is a standalone scouting simulation. No tactics screen. No team talks. No press conferences.

You ARE the scout.

You watch youth matches. You attend grassroots tournaments and school games. You write scouting reports. You build a network. You earn a reputation. You find the wonderkid before the world knows his name.

That's the whole game.

We're launching on Steam on [LAUNCH DATE].

**[WISHLIST TALENTSCOUT ON STEAM]**

If you've ever thought "I could've spotted Messi at 13" -- this is the game that lets you prove it.

More details coming soon. But for now: add it to your wishlist. You're going to want to be first.

-- The TalentScout Team

---

**P.S.** You're not the manager. You're the reason the manager has anyone worth picking. That's the pitch. That's the game.

---
---

## Email 2: The World — "What you'll actually do"

**Send timing:** Day -10 (ten days before launch), Thursday at 7:00 PM local
**Rationale:** Four days after the announcement. Enough gap for the first email to settle, soon enough to maintain momentum. Thursday evening -- the weekend is close, gaming mindset is building.

---

### Subject Line Variants

#### A: "What you'll actually do in TalentScout" -- recommended
Safe bet: Direct benefit. Answers the question every interested subscriber has after Email 1. "Actually" signals substance over hype -- no marketing fluff, just the game.

**Preview text:** "Youth matches. School games. Muddy pitches. Your career."

#### B: "Rain in Rosario. A youth cup nobody's watching."
Bold play: Scene-setting cold open. Drops the reader into a scouting moment. No context, no explanation -- trusts them to get it. High open rate from the curious, some confusion from the rest.

**Preview text:** "Except you. That's where your career starts."

#### C: "from Sunday league to Champions League shortlists"
Personal touch: Lowercase, paints the progression arc in seven words. Feels aspirational without being corporate. Taps the grassroots-to-glory fantasy.

**Preview text:** "Your scouting career starts at the bottom."

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests clarity vs atmosphere. Do they want to know what the game is, or do they want to feel what it's like? Reveals whether the audience is feature-driven or fantasy-driven.

---

### Email Copy

So you know what TalentScout is. Now here's what you'll actually do.

**You watch matches.**

Not from a tactics screen. Not from a spreadsheet. You're in the stands -- youth cups, grassroots tournaments, school games, academy fixtures. You pick which matches to attend. You decide who to watch.

A 15-year-old in the third tier of Argentine football. Left foot like a wand. Nobody's heard of him yet. That's your job.

**You write reports.**

You've watched the player. Now tell the club what you saw. Rate his attributes. Flag his potential. Recommend -- or don't. Your reputation rides on your judgment.

Get it right, and the club trusts you with bigger matches. Bigger leagues. Bigger stakes.

Get it wrong, and you're back to watching under-14s in the rain.

**You build a career.**

Start as a youth scout covering local pitches. Work your way up:

- Youth scout -- local matches, small network
- Regional scout -- wider territory, more competition
- Senior scout -- first-team targets, international coverage
- Chief scout -- you shape the club's entire recruitment strategy

Your network grows. Your scouting range expands. Your shortlist gets more dangerous.

**You find the wonderkid before anyone else.**

That's it. That's the game. No tactics. No team talks. Just the hunt.

**[WISHLIST ON STEAM]**

Know someone who spends hours hunting wonderkids in FM? Send them this email. They'll thank you later.

-- The TalentScout Team

---

**P.S.** We haven't even talked about the eye test yet. Trusting your gut over the data. That's coming. For now -- wishlist and tell a friend.

---
---

## Email 3: Social Proof / Behind the Scenes — "Built by people who get it"

**Send timing:** Day -7 (one week before launch), Tuesday at 7:00 PM local
**Rationale:** One week out. The midpoint of the sequence. This is the trust-building email -- social proof and behind-the-scenes authenticity before the urgency emails begin.

---

### Subject Line Variants

#### A: "Built by people who get it" -- recommended
Safe bet: Self-selecting. If you "get it" -- if you're part of this niche -- you open this email. Signals authenticity and insider knowledge. No hype, just credibility.

**Preview text:** "The team behind TalentScout and why this game exists."

#### B: "We watched 200 hours of youth football for this game"
Bold play: Specific, slightly absurd number that proves obsession. Stands out in any inbox. Some will laugh, some will nod -- both open the email.

**Preview text:** "And we'd do it again. Here's what we learned."

#### C: "why we made a game about being the scout"
Personal touch: Lowercase, origin-story framing. Feels like a blog post from a dev you'd follow. Conversational, not salesy.

**Preview text:** "The honest answer from the team building it."

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests identity signaling ("people who get it") against proof of obsession ("200 hours"). Reveals whether the audience wants to feel part of a tribe or wants evidence of authenticity.

---

### Email Copy

One week out.

Before we get into launch-week mode, we want to tell you who's building this thing.

We're a small team. We're not EA. We're not Sports Interactive. We're the people who played FM for thousands of hours and kept saying the same thing:

"Why can't I just be the scout?"

We've played every Football Manager since Championship Manager 01/02. We've run databases on wonderkids. We've argued about whether a 16-year-old's PA justifies a 40M release clause.

We watch youth football. On purpose. For fun.

TalentScout didn't come from a market analysis. It came from a group chat where someone said "what if scouting was the whole game?" and nobody could stop talking about it.

**What we put into it:**

- Researched real scouting methodologies. How professional scouts actually evaluate talent. Not just "pace 17, dribbling 15" -- the way a scout watches movement off the ball, decision-making under pressure, body language after a mistake.
- Built a progression system based on real career paths. Youth scout to chief scout isn't just a title change -- your responsibilities, your network, your access to leagues all shift.
- Talked to the community. Early testers from the FM subreddit, Discord servers, football analytics Twitter. They told us what they wanted. We listened.

**What early testers are saying:**

"This is the game I didn't know I was waiting for. I spent three hours watching U-17 matches and completely forgot I was playing a game."

"Finally. A game that understands why I have a spreadsheet of Colombian forwards under 18."

"The feeling when your recommended player makes the first team. Nothing else in football gaming gives you that."

We built this for the people who think scouting IS the game. If that's you -- you're going to feel at home.

**[JOIN OUR DISCORD]**

Come talk scouting with us. We're in there every day, sharing dev updates, discussing wonderkid archetypes, and taking feedback right up to launch.

**[FOLLOW US ON TWITTER/X]** for daily updates this launch week.

-- The TalentScout Team

**P.S.** Launch is one week from today. If you haven't wishlisted yet: **[WISHLIST ON STEAM]**. The algorithm loves it, and so do we.

---
---

## Email 4: Launch Week Hype — "Your scouting career starts [date]"

**Send timing:** Day -3 (three days before launch), Thursday at 7:00 PM local
**Rationale:** Three days out. Close enough to feel real, far enough to build one final wave of anticipation. This is the urgency email -- make them feel the countdown.

---

### Subject Line Variants

#### A: "Your scouting career starts [launch day]" -- recommended
Safe bet: Date-specific. Creates a mental calendar marker. Frames launch day not as a product release but as the start of something personal -- their career.

**Preview text:** "[X] days. Here's everything you're getting."

#### B: "3 days until kickoff"
Bold play: Short. Football metaphor. Urgency without desperation. "Kickoff" reframes the launch as a match day -- something the audience emotionally responds to.

**Preview text:** "Your scouting empire starts from the whistle."

#### C: "you ready for this?"
Personal touch: Lowercase, direct, conversational. Feels like a friend texting before a big event. Creates excitement through informality.

**Preview text:** "TalentScout launches in 3 days. Quick recap."

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests personal framing ("your career") against sports metaphor ("kickoff"). Reveals whether the audience connects more with the career fantasy or the match-day energy.

---

### Email Copy

[X] days.

In [X] days, you can stop wishlisting and start scouting.

Here's what's waiting for you on launch day:

**The scouting world:**
- Youth matches across multiple countries and leagues
- Grassroots tournaments, school games, academy fixtures
- Different weather, different pitches, different levels -- each one hiding potential

**Your career:**
- Start as a youth scout. Prove yourself one report at a time.
- Expand your network. Unlock new regions.
- Work your way to chief scout. Shape an entire club's recruitment.

**The hunt:**
- Watch players live. No star ratings. Trust your eyes.
- Write scouting reports that build your reputation -- or destroy it.
- Find the hidden gem in the third tier that everyone else missed.
- Get the call when your recommended player makes the first team.

**The feeling:**
That moment when a player you spotted at 15 walks onto the first-team pitch for the first time. You saw it coming. Nobody else did.

That's what this game is about.

If you haven't wishlisted yet, now's the time:

**[WISHLIST ON STEAM]**

Already wishlisted? Do us a massive favour -- send this email to one person. That friend who makes wonderkid spreadsheets. The one who watches youth football on YouTube at 2 AM. The one who argues about which Brazilian 16-year-old has the highest ceiling.

They need to know about this.

-- The TalentScout Team

---

**P.S.** Launch day is [DATE]. We'll send one more email that morning when the game goes live. After that, we shut up and let you scout.

---
---

## Email 5: Launch Day — "The whistle blows. Your career starts now."

**Send timing:** Day 0 (launch day), Tuesday at 10:00 AM local
**Rationale:** Morning send on launch day. Catches people at the start of their day so the game is on their mind. Morning launches historically perform well on Steam for visibility during the peak browsing window.

---

### Subject Line Variants

#### A: "TalentScout is live. Go scout." -- recommended
Safe bet: Clear, direct, action-oriented. No ambiguity about what this email is. "Go scout" is a command that puts them in the role immediately.

**Preview text:** "Your scouting career starts right now. Steam link inside."

#### B: "The whistle blows."
Bold play: Three words. Football metaphor as a launch announcement. Atmospheric, dramatic, and trusts the reader to know exactly what it means. High open from the engaged, some confusion from the casually subscribed.

**Preview text:** "TalentScout is live on Steam. Your career starts now."

#### C: "it's here."
Personal touch: Lowercase. Two words. The energy of a friend texting you the moment something drops. No explanation needed -- they've been waiting.

**Preview text:** "TalentScout just went live. Go find the next wonderkid."

**Recommended A/B test:** A vs B
**Reason:** Tests direct announcement ("is live") against atmospheric brevity ("the whistle blows"). Reveals whether launch-day emails need clarity or drama for this audience.

---

### Email Copy

## Campaign Brief

### Goal
Drive Steam wishlists pre-launch and convert to purchases on launch day through a 5-email sequence that builds anticipation, establishes credibility, and channels the audience's existing scouting obsession into action.

### Sequence Type
Launch

### Emails
5 emails over 14 days (Day -14 through Day 0)

### Angle
The Untold Role -- every football game lets you be the manager. None let you be the person who actually finds the talent. Until now.

### Audience Segment
FM players, simulation junkies, football fans who obsess over youth development and wonderkids. High jargon tolerance. Deep football knowledge. They know what PA means, what regens are, what scouting range does.

### Paid Offer
TalentScout -- standalone scouting simulation on Steam (price TBD)

### Bridge Logic
These are people who already spend hours scouting in FM as a sub-feature. TalentScout makes that obsession the entire game. The bridge is their own existing behaviour -- they already do this, now there's a game built around it.

### Timeline
Day -14 through Day 0

### ESP
Manual / copy-paste (no ESP connected)

### Status
Draft

### Voice Notes
Heavy football jargon, casual tone, insider-to-insider register. Short paragraphs. Sentence fragments for impact. Never sounds like a game studio marketing department -- sounds like a scout who happens to also be building a game. Reference FM, wonderkids, regens, scouting reports. Assume the audience knows what all of these mean.

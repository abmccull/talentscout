# TalentScout Voice Profile

## Voice Summary
Sounds like the scout who's been to every U-17 tournament in South America, who has a spreadsheet of Brazilian second-division wonderkids, and who can't shut up about the left-footed centre-back he spotted in a rainy youth cup match in Rosario. Knowledgeable without being academic. Passionate to the point of obsession. Speaks football culture fluently — not as a commentator, but as someone who lives in the weeds of youth development, potential ratings, and the thrill of being right about a player before anyone else knew his name.

## Core Personality Traits
- **Obsessive scout energy:** This voice lives and breathes talent identification. Every conversation loops back to the hunt — the thrill of the find, the pattern recognition, the gut feeling backed by data. Not casual interest. This is "I watched three hours of Uruguayan U-15 footage last night" energy.
- **In-the-know insider:** Speaks like someone who has access the average fan doesn't. Not arrogant — just deeper in the game. References specific leagues, age groups, positions, and development paths. Makes the reader feel like they're getting insider knowledge.
- **Passionate but grounded:** Gets genuinely excited about talent but backs it up. Not hype — conviction. The difference between "this kid is amazing" and "this kid's progressive carries per 90 from left-back are elite for his age group." Emotion plus evidence.
- **Community-first indie spirit:** Small team, big ambitions. Doesn't pretend to be EA Sports. Leans into being the game built by people who actually care about this niche — not a corporation ticking a market segment box.

## Tone Spectrum

| Dimension | Position | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Formal ↔ Casual | Casual — pub conversation between scouts | Football talk, not press conference talk. Contractions, sentence fragments, the way people actually discuss players |
| Serious ↔ Playful | Serious core with playful moments | The subject matter (scouting, talent) is treated with genuine passion. Humour comes from shared obsession — inside jokes about regens, wonderkids, save-scumming |
| Reserved ↔ Bold | Bold — makes claims, picks sides | "This is the game for people who think they could've spotted Messi at 13." Confident about what the game is and who it's for. Not afraid to be niche |
| Simple ↔ Sophisticated | Simple language, sophisticated knowledge | Short words, deep football intelligence. Never dumbs down the football — assumes the audience knows what a double pivot is |
| Warm ↔ Direct | Direct with warmth underneath | Gets to the point. But there's genuine love for the game underneath every line. Not cold — just efficient, the way a scout's report is efficient |

## Vocabulary

**Words/phrases to USE:**
- "Wonderkid" — the holy grail, the thing everyone's chasing
- "Potential" / "ceiling" — the language of what a player could become
- "Spot" / "spotted" / "the find" — the core verb of scouting
- "Youth setup" / "academy" / "development pathway" — the ecosystem
- "First team" — the destination, the proof your scouting was right
- "Gem" / "hidden gem" — the unknown player who turns out to be special
- "Your network" / "your reputation" — the progression mechanics
- "Build your scouting empire" — the macro aspiration
- "The next [Messi/Haaland/whoever]" — the dream scenario
- "Deep cut" — for obscure leagues, unknown players
- "Shortlist" — the scout's working document
- "Before anyone else" — the competitive edge of discovery
- "In the weeds" — for the detail-obsessed audience

**Words/phrases to AVOID:**
- "Utilize" / "leverage" / "synergy" — corporate speak has no place here
- "Content" / "experience" / "user" — don't talk like a product manager, talk like a scout
- "Casual fun for everyone" — this is not a casual game and should never pretend to be
- "Innovative" / "revolutionary" / "next-gen" — indie games don't need hype words, they need authenticity
- "Passionate about gaming" — empty. Show the passion through football knowledge, don't declare it
- "Realistic simulation" — too generic. Say what's actually realistic about it
- "Compelling gameplay loop" — game-dev jargon the audience doesn't use
- "AAA quality" — don't compete on production value, compete on depth and soul

**Jargon level:** Heavy football jargon, moderate game jargon — the audience knows what "PA" (potential ability) means, what a "regen" is, what "scouting range" means. Use it. Don't explain it. They'll feel at home.

**Profanity:** Occasional, natural — the way it slips out when you're watching a 16-year-old pull off a Cruyff turn in a youth match. Never forced. Never edgy for the sake of it.

## Rhythm & Structure

**Sentences:** Mix of short punchy fragments and medium sentences. Short for impact ("You spotted him first."), medium for context. Long sentences only when painting a scene — describing a match, a moment, a player.

**Paragraphs:** Short. 1-3 sentences. Let the football imagery breathe. The audience reads quickly and skims — respect that.

**Openings:** Scene-setting or bold claim. "Rain in Rosario. A youth cup semifinal nobody's watching. Except you." OR "You don't play as the manager. You play as the person who found the manager's best player."

**Formatting:** Bold for emphasis. Short paragraphs. Bullet points for features. No emoji overload — this isn't mobile gaming. The occasional football emoji is fine. Screenshots and match footage do heavy lifting.

## POV & Address

**First person:** We (the team building the game) when talking about development. "You" when putting the player in the scout's shoes — which should be most of the time.
**Reader address:** You, always. Direct. "You're in the stands. You're watching the match. You see what nobody else sees."
**Relationship stance:** Insider-to-insider. We're all obsessed with the same thing. The dev team is part of the same community as the players. Peer, not seller. Fellow scout, not corporation.

## Platform Adaptations

| Platform | Tone Shift | Structure | Length |
|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Steam Store Page | Most polished — still the scout voice but tighter, benefit-focused. Every sentence earns its place | Hook headline, short feature blocks, screenshots carry weight, social proof from community | 300-600 words total |
| Email / Newsletter | Warmer, more personal — "here's what we've been working on." Dev diary energy mixed with scouting stories | Short paragraphs, one main update, one CTA. Can include a "scout's pick" — a fictional player profile | 200-400 words |
| Twitter/X | Sharpest, most opinionated. Hot takes about scouting, football culture, the game. Fragments and bold claims | One idea per tweet. Threads for dev updates or scouting stories. Screenshots and GIFs | Under 280 chars per tweet |
| Reddit / Forums | Most community-native. Speak like a fellow FM player. Engage in discussions, share behind-the-scenes | Longer posts OK. Respond to feedback directly. Use the community's language | Varies — match the thread |
| YouTube / Trailer | Scene-setting and cinematic. The scout's internal monologue. Atmospheric, emotional, building to the hook | Voiceover-friendly pacing. Short sentences. Build tension. End on the promise | 60-120 seconds of script |
| Discord | Most casual, most real-time. The dev team hanging out with the community. Quick, responsive, genuine | Short messages, reactions, sharing WIPs. No corporate announcements — conversations | Brief |

## Example Phrases

**On-brand (sounds like us):**
- "You're not the manager. You're the reason the manager has anyone worth picking."
- "A 15-year-old in the third tier of Argentine football. Left foot like a wand. Nobody's heard of him yet. That's your job."
- "Build your network. Earn your reputation. Find the wonderkid before the world does."
- "This is the game for people who watch U-17 tournaments on purpose."
- "Every scout has a story about the one who got away. In TalentScout, you write those stories."
- "We built this because Football Manager never let us be the scout. So we made a whole game about it."

**Off-brand (doesn't sound like us):**
- "TalentScout is an innovative football simulation experience for all ages." — Corporate, generic, says nothing. No soul.
- "Discover exciting gameplay mechanics and compelling progression systems!" — Product manager voice. The audience wants to discover players, not mechanics.
- "Our team is passionate about delivering a high-quality gaming experience." — Empty declaration. Show the passion through the football, not through marketing speak.
- "Perfect for casual fans and hardcore gamers alike!" — Pick a side. We picked ours. This is for the obsessives.
- "Pre-order now and receive exclusive bonus content!" — We're indie. We don't do manufactured urgency. We do "this is the game you've been waiting for."

## Do's and Don'ts

**DO:**
- Put the reader in the scout's shoes immediately — "You're watching. You see it. Nobody else does."
- Use specific football details — positions, age groups, leagues, attributes. The audience knows the game.
- Lean into the obsession — it's not weird to watch youth football for hours, it's the whole point
- Reference the culture — FM, wonderkids, regens, scouting databases. These people are our people.
- Be honest about being indie — small team, big vision, built by people who care about this niche
- Let the football do the selling — a well-described scouting moment is better than any feature bullet

**DON'T:**
- Water down the niche — trying to appeal to everyone means appealing to no one
- Use generic game marketing language — "immersive," "engaging," "state-of-the-art"
- Talk about the game like a product — talk about it like a world you're inviting people into
- Over-promise on graphics or production value — promise depth, authenticity, and the feeling of discovery
- Forget the emotional core — scouting is about the thrill of being right. That's what we're selling.
- Treat the audience as customers — they're fellow scouts. We just happen to also be building the game.

## VISUAL BIBLE — Read This First

Every Veo 3 prompt references this locked description. Copy-paste the relevant
sections into each prompt to maintain consistency across clips.

### The Scout (appears in shots 1, 2, 4a/b/c, 5, 9)

```
A man in his late 40s, weathered face, short grey-flecked dark hair, clean-shaven.
He wears a dark navy wool overcoat over a charcoal sweater, dark trousers, and
worn brown leather shoes. He carries a small leather-bound notebook and a red pen.
He is lean, average height, quiet posture — not athletic, not imposing. He looks
like someone who watches for a living. His face is never fully lit — always partial
shadow, side-lit, or silhouetted. We see his profile, his back, his hands — never
a clean front-facing close-up.
```

### The Pitch (appears in shots 1, 2, 3, 9)

```
A small South American youth football ground at night. Concrete terraces with no
seats — just stepped concrete. No dugouts. Two tall floodlight poles with warm
amber tungsten bulbs, not modern white LED. The pitch is natural grass, worn and
slightly muddy. White line markings are faded. A chain-link fence runs along one
side. The sky is deep blue-black, overcast, no stars. Heavy rain is falling
steadily. The floodlights create visible amber light shafts through the rain.
Puddles reflect the amber light on the concrete. This is not a professional
stadium — it is a modest local ground that holds maybe 500 people.
```

### The Young Player (appears in shots 2, 3)

```
A teenage male footballer, approximately 16 years old, slim athletic build, dark
hair, wearing a plain dark navy jersey with no visible logos, dark shorts, dark
socks. He is always seen from behind, from the side, or at a distance — his face
is never clearly visible. He moves with calm intelligence, not flashy speed.
```

### Color & Grade (apply to ALL Veo 3 shots)

```
Cinematic color grading: deep navy-black shadows (#0A1628), warm amber-tungsten
highlights (#D4A843), desaturated muted green for grass (#2D5A3D). Heavy film
grain. Anamorphic widescreen look with subtle horizontal lens flares from light
sources. Contrast is high — deep blacks, limited midtones, warm highlights only
where light falls. The overall feeling is a 35mm film shot in available light
at night.
```

### Audio Rule (CRITICAL — apply to ALL Veo 3 shots)

```
AUDIO: Ambient environmental sound only. Sound of steady rain hitting concrete
and metal. Distant muffled crowd murmur. No dialogue. No voiceover. No narration.
No one speaks. No music. No soundtrack.
```

### Universal Negative Prompts (include with every generation)

```
No text on screen. No titles. No graphics. No UI overlays. No watermarks. No
subtitles. No logos on jerseys or buildings. No modern LED floodlights — only
warm amber tungsten. No bright saturated colors. No daylight. No sunshine. No
one looks directly at the camera. No one speaks or mouths words.
```

## TRANSITION MAP — How Every Cut Works

Each transition is designed so the **end frame** of one clip visually connects
to the **start frame** of the next. The prompts below bake this into the Veo 3
generation so clips cut together naturally.

| Cut Point | From → To | Transition Type | What Connects Them | Post Work |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 1 → 2 | Pitch wide → Notebook CU | Hard cut | Both rain + amber light. Shot 1 ends on the pitch revealed. Shot 2 opens on hands in the same rain. The location is the same — we just jumped closer. | Clean hard cut. Match rain intensity. |
| 2 → 3 | Notebook tilt-up → Player | Hard cut on motion | Shot 2 ends tilting up to show the blurred pitch. Shot 3 opens already on the pitch at player level. We were looking at the pitch, now we're on it. | Cut on the upward tilt momentum. The eye is already moving toward the pitch. |
| 3 → 4A | Night rain → Golden hour | Whip-to-black + fade in | Shot 3 ends with the player's pass leaving frame right. Shot 4A opens on a different world — golden sunlight. The contrast is intentional (night→day, rain→sun). Need a breath between them. | 6-frame fade to black between clips. Or: let Shot 3's final frame motion-blur to black, then fade up on 4A. Music shifts here too. |
| 4A → 4B | South America → England | Match cut | Both shots frame the scout in the same position in frame (center, medium shot). 4A ends with him walking toward camera (approaching). 4B opens with him already seated (arrived). Same man, different world. | Quick crossfade (8-12 frames / 0.3-0.5 sec). The coat is the visual anchor — dark navy in both frames. |
| 4B → 4C | England → Academy | Match cut | Both shots show the scout from behind/side. 4B is static (seated). 4C is moving (walking). Same coat, same notebook. The cut is on the contrast: cold outdoor → sterile indoor. | Quick crossfade (8-12 frames). Or hard cut — the environment change is jarring on purpose. |
| 4C → 5 | Academy corridor → Car | Hard cut | 4C: scout walks right through a modern corridor, glass reflecting. 5: scout sits in a car, seen through glass (windshield). Glass is the visual link. Both frames show the man through/behind glass. | Hard cut. The glass-to-glass visual rhyme makes it seamless. |
| 5 → 6 | Car (rain blur) → Game UI | Dissolve (KEY transition) | Shot 5 ends with rain distorting the windshield — the man becomes a blurred dark shape behind rain-streaked glass. The game UI scouting report has a dark background. The blur becomes the dark UI. | 1-2 second crossfade in post. The rain-blurred silhouette dissolves into the dark game UI. This is the "real world becomes game" moment. Consider adding a subtle digital scan-line effect during the dissolve. |
| 6 → 7 | Game UI → Game UI | Hard cut (fast) | Game footage to game footage. Standard fast-cut montage. | Standard editing. Cuts get progressively faster (2 sec → 1.5 sec). |
| 7 → 8 | Game UI → Game UI | Hard cut (faster) | Continuation of gameplay montage. | Cuts at 1.5 sec. Music building. |
| 8 → 9A | Game UI → Night rain wide | Dissolve (KEY transition) | Shot 8 ends on a career milestone screen (dark UI, text). Shot 9A opens on the wide shot of the empty ground — dark, amber, rain. The dark game screen dissolves into the dark rainy scene. We return to reality. | 1-2 second crossfade. The game's dark UI background melts into the night sky. Consider the game's last frame being a news headline about a player debut — the screen dims, and the rain emerges behind it. |
| 9A → 9B | Scout walks away → Empty seat | Seamless continuation | These are the same shot from the same camera angle. 9A ends with the man walking away to the right, exiting frame. 9B is the same frame with no one in it. | If generated separately: hard cut works because the camera is static and the composition is identical. If the man hasn't quite exited in 9A, overlap the two clips and use a 4-frame crossfade. Ideally, try to generate these as one long clip. |
| 9B → 10 | Empty seat → Title card | Fade to black | Shot 9B holds on the empty wet terraces. The image slowly dims. Black. Then the title appears. | 1.5-second fade to black on 9B. Hold black for 0.5 sec. Then title card fades in. |

## Shot 1 / 10 — COLD OPEN (0:00–0:08)

**VO (added in post):** "Rain in Rosario. A youth cup semifinal. Nobody's watching."

**TRANSITION IN:** Fade from black (first shot of the trailer).
**TRANSITION OUT → Shot 2:** Hard cut. Shot ends on a wide view of the amber-lit
pitch with rain falling — the same setting Shot 2 opens in, just closer.

**Veo 3 prompt:**
```
A slow cinematic dolly forward toward a youth football pitch at night, viewed
through a chain-link fence. The camera starts tight on the diamond pattern of the
fence with the pitch blurred behind it, then slowly racks focus to reveal the
pitch as the camera drifts forward. Heavy steady rain falls through two tall
amber tungsten floodlight beams, creating visible golden light shafts. The pitch
is natural grass, slightly muddy, with faded white line markings. About thirty
to forty people stand scattered along the far touchline — small dark figures, no
umbrellas, just watching in the rain. Two coaches in dark rain jackets stand at
the edge of the pitch. No dugouts. Concrete stepped terraces on both sides, mostly
empty. A youth football match is in progress — teenage players in dark jerseys
move in the middle distance, but they are not the focus. The focus is the
atmosphere: the rain, the amber light, the emptiness, the isolation of this
small ground at night. Deep blue-black sky, overcast. Puddles on the concrete
reflect amber light.

The shot BEGINS on the chain-link fence filling the frame with the pitch as
blurred amber bokeh behind it. The shot ENDS with the fence out of frame and
the full pitch visible in deep focus — a wide view of the ground with rain
falling through amber floodlight beams, the pitch stretching out in front of us.
The final frame should be a stable, wide composition of the rainy pitch under
amber light.

Shot on 35mm anamorphic lens, heavy film grain, shallow depth of field
transitioning to deep focus. The camera movement is slow and steady — no
handheld shake. Color: deep navy blacks, warm amber tungsten highlights,
desaturated muted green grass.

AUDIO: Steady rain on metal and concrete. Distant muffled crowd murmur. A
referee whistle in the far distance. No dialogue. No voiceover. No music.
No one speaks.

No text on screen. No titles. No logos. No modern LED lights.
```

**Camera:** Slow dolly forward, rack focus from fence to pitch
**Duration:** 8 seconds
**Start frame:** Chain-link fence pattern fills the screen, pitch is blurred amber behind
**End frame:** Wide view of the full rainy pitch under amber floodlights, stable composition

---

## Shot 2 / 10 — THE NOTEBOOK (0:08–0:16)

**VO (added in post):** "Except you." *(2-sec beat of silence)* "A left-footed centre-back. Sixteen years old."

**TRANSITION IN from Shot 1:** Hard cut. We were looking at the pitch from
distance — now we jump to an extreme close-up of hands in the same rain.
The amber light and rain connect the two shots. The location hasn't changed,
just our proximity.
**TRANSITION OUT → Shot 3:** Hard cut on the upward tilt. Shot 2 ends with
the camera tilted up, showing the blurry pitch through amber bokeh. Shot 3
opens already on the pitch at player level — we're now seeing what the scout
was looking at.

**Veo 3 prompt:**
```
Extreme close-up of a man's hands holding open a small leather-bound notebook in
the rain at night. The hands belong to a man in his late 40s — weathered skin,
no rings, short clean nails. He holds a red pen in his right hand. The notebook
page is filled with small handwritten notes — abbreviations, arrows, a circled
word. Raindrops land on the open page, wetting the edges. The man slowly and
deliberately underlines a word on the page with the red pen, pressing firmly.
The camera holds tight on the notebook for four seconds, then begins a slow
tilt upward — past the man's dark navy wool overcoat sleeve, past his chest,
continuing up and over his shoulder to reveal a rain-soaked youth football pitch
in the background, out of focus with warm amber floodlight bokeh. Small dark
figures of teenage players move on the pitch in the soft background blur. The
man never turns around — we see only the back of his head and his grey-flecked
dark hair. Rain continues falling through the amber light.

The shot BEGINS filling the frame entirely with the open notebook and the man's
hands — no pitch visible, just the notebook, the red pen, rain on paper. The
shot ENDS looking past the man's shoulder at the blurry amber-lit pitch beyond
him. The final frame composition: the man's dark shoulder and head fill the
bottom-left of frame, and the rest of the frame is the soft amber bokeh of the
floodlit pitch with dark player silhouettes moving in the blur.

Shot on 35mm anamorphic lens, heavy film grain. Shallow depth of field — the
notebook is razor sharp, everything beyond the man's hands is soft bokeh.

AUDIO: Close-up sound of rain hitting paper and leather. The scratch of pen on
paper. Distant muffled crowd in the background. No dialogue. No voiceover. No
music. No one speaks.

No text on screen. No titles. No graphics. No readable words on the notebook
page — just the impression of handwriting.
```

**Camera:** Static close-up, slow tilt up over shoulder
**Duration:** 8 seconds
**Start frame:** Notebook fills the entire frame — hands, red pen, rain on paper
**End frame:** Blurry amber pitch visible past the scout's dark shoulder, player shapes in bokeh

---

## Shot 3 / 10 — THE PLAYER (0:16–0:24)

**VO (added in post):** "Reads the game two seconds ahead of everyone on that pitch."

**TRANSITION IN from Shot 2:** Hard cut. Shot 2 ended looking toward the blurry
pitch from behind the scout. Now we cut to being ON the pitch, at player level.
The amber light and rain are identical — same location, same moment, new
perspective. We went from watching the scout watch, to seeing what he sees.
**TRANSITION OUT → Shot 4A:** Whip-to-black. Shot 3 ends as the player's pass
leaves frame right and the camera's tracking motion continues slightly past
him, creating natural motion blur. In post: let that final-frame motion blur
darken to black (6-8 frames), then fade up on the warm golden light of Shot 4A.
This is a deliberate palette break: cold blue-black rain → warm golden sunlight.

**Veo 3 prompt:**
```
Slow motion cinematic shot of a teenage male footballer, approximately 16 years
old, slim athletic build, dark hair, wearing a plain dark navy jersey, dark
shorts, dark socks. He stands on a rain-soaked grass pitch at night under warm
amber tungsten floodlights. The camera is at his waist height, positioned to
his left side, slowly tracking alongside him. He is looking away from camera,
scanning the pitch — his head turns smoothly from left to right, reading the
space ahead of him. His body language is calm and composed. A football rolls
toward him from off-screen right. Without looking down at the ball, he receives
it with his left foot and in one fluid motion plays a long diagonal pass forward
with his left foot. The pass leaves frame to the right. He continues scanning
the pitch after the pass, already thinking about the next movement. Rain falls
steadily through the amber floodlight beams behind him, creating golden light
shafts. Other players are blurred dark shapes moving in the background. His face
is mostly in shadow — we see his profile and jawline but not a clear frontal
view. The slow motion makes the rain droplets hang in the amber light around him.

The shot BEGINS with the player already in frame from his left side, standing
still on the pitch, head starting to turn. He is the only sharp element — the
background is soft amber bokeh with dark shapes. The shot ENDS after the pass
is made, with the camera still tracking slightly rightward past the player —
the player begins to drift out of the left side of frame, and the final frames
show the dark pitch stretching away to the right with amber floodlight beams
and rain. The rightward camera drift at the end creates a slight motion blur
in the final frame.

Shot on 35mm anamorphic lens, heavy film grain. Horizontal lens flare from the
floodlight behind him. Deep navy-black shadows, warm amber highlights on his
shoulders and the rain.

AUDIO: Muffled slow-motion ambient sound. The thud of a football being kicked.
Rain in slow motion — deep, low-frequency patter. No dialogue. No voiceover.
No music. No one speaks.

No text on screen. No titles. No logos on the jersey. His face is never fully
visible — always side-lit or in shadow.
```

**Camera:** Low angle, slow lateral track left-to-right, slow motion
**Duration:** 8 seconds
**Start frame:** Player standing on rain-soaked pitch, seen from left side, amber bokeh background
**End frame:** Camera drifting right, player exiting left of frame, dark pitch with amber light shafts, slight motion blur

## Shot 4A / 10 — THE JOURNEY: SOUTH AMERICA (0:24–0:28)

**VO (added in post, spans 4A+4B+4C):** "Everyone talks about the manager. The tactics. The transfers. The trophies."

**TRANSITION IN from Shot 3:** Fade from black. After Shot 3's motion blur
darkens to black in post (6-8 frames), hold black for 4 frames, then fade up
on the warm golden light of this shot. The palette shift is dramatic and
intentional: we leave the cold rainy night and enter warm golden hour sunlight.
This is a new chapter.
**TRANSITION OUT → Shot 4B:** Quick crossfade (10-12 frames / 0.4 sec). Both
shots frame the scout center-frame in his dark navy coat. The coat is the visual
anchor that connects two different worlds.

**Veo 3 prompt:**
```
A lone man in his late 40s walks through a rusted metal turnstile into a small
open-air South American football ground during golden hour. He wears a dark navy
wool overcoat over a charcoal sweater, dark trousers, and carries a small
leather-bound notebook in his left hand. The camera is positioned inside the
ground, facing the turnstile, so we see him enter toward us. The ground has
open concrete terraces with faded painted walls in pale blue and white. Warm
golden sunlight comes from a low angle behind him, casting a long shadow ahead
of him on the concrete. The terraces are nearly empty — maybe a dozen people
scattered around. A grass pitch is visible behind the camera's position, out
of focus. Dust motes float in the golden light. The man walks with purpose,
alone, looking toward the pitch. His face is side-lit by the setting sun —
profile visible but not a front-on portrait.

The shot BEGINS with the man stepping through the turnstile at the far end of
the frame — he is small, framed by the turnstile structure and the concrete
walls on either side, golden light behind him. The shot ENDS with the man
having walked closer to camera, now filling the center of frame in a medium
shot from the waist up, his dark navy coat prominent against the warm golden
background. His body is center-frame as the shot ends — this framing will
match Shot 4B where he is also center-frame.

Shot on 35mm anamorphic lens, heavy film grain. Color: warm golden amber light,
faded concrete blues and whites, deep shadows in the turnstile area.

AUDIO: Distant Latin American crowd chatter. Metal turnstile clicking. Footsteps
on concrete. No dialogue. No voiceover. No music. No one speaks.

No text on screen. No titles. No logos. No modern elements.
```

**Camera:** Static medium-wide, man walks toward camera
**Duration:** 8 seconds (generate full 8, trim to 4 in post — take the best 4 seconds)
**Start frame:** Scout small in frame, stepping through turnstile, golden light behind
**End frame:** Scout center-frame, medium shot, dark coat against warm golden background

---

## Shot 4B / 10 — THE JOURNEY: ENGLAND (0:28–0:32)

**TRANSITION IN from Shot 4A:** Quick crossfade (10-12 frames). The scout was
center-frame in warm golden light. Now he's center-frame in cold grey light.
Same man, same coat, different world. The crossfade makes the background change
while the dark coat stays anchored in the center.
**TRANSITION OUT → Shot 4C:** Quick crossfade (10-12 frames) or hard cut. Both
shots show the scout from behind. 4B: seated, static, outdoor. 4C: walking,
moving, indoor. The cut rhythm is: enter (4A) → sit (4B) → walk (4C).

**Veo 3 prompt:**
```
A lone man in his late 40s sits alone in metal stadium seats at a cold, grey
English non-league football ground during a daytime match. He wears a dark navy
wool overcoat over a charcoal sweater, collar turned up against the cold. His
breath is visible in the cold air. He holds a small leather-bound notebook open
on his knee and watches the pitch intently. The camera is positioned three rows
behind him and slightly to the right, looking past his shoulder toward the pitch.
The stands are almost entirely empty — six or seven other spectators are scattered
far apart, bundled in coats and scarves. The sky is flat overcast grey. The pitch
below is muddy and worn. A simple metal railing runs along the front of the stand.
No fancy stadium — this is a ground that holds a few hundred people. The man is
still, focused, writing something in his notebook without looking down.

The shot BEGINS with the man already seated, centered in frame, seen from behind
and slightly above. His dark navy coat is the darkest element against the grey
sky and pale metal seats. The shot ENDS on the same static composition — the man
has not moved significantly, but his hand has finished writing a note. He is
still center-frame, seen from behind, the grey pitch stretching out beyond him.

Shot on 35mm anamorphic lens, heavy film grain. Color: cold desaturated grey-blue
overall, the man's dark navy coat is the darkest element, no warm tones — this
is cold English football.

AUDIO: Cold wind. Sparse distant shouts from the pitch. A football being kicked.
No dialogue. No voiceover. No music. No one speaks.

No text on screen. No titles. No logos. No modern LED advertising boards.
```

**Camera:** Static over-the-shoulder from behind, slightly elevated
**Duration:** 8 seconds (generate full 8, trim to 4 in post)
**Start frame:** Scout centered from behind in grey metal stands, dark coat against grey sky
**End frame:** Same composition, scout still center-frame from behind

---

## Shot 4C / 10 — THE JOURNEY: ACADEMY (0:32–0:36)

**TRANSITION IN from Shot 4B:** Quick crossfade (10-12 frames) or hard cut.
We go from the scout seated outdoors in the cold to walking indoors through
glass. Both shots show him from behind/side. The contrast of environment is the
point: muddy non-league → gleaming academy.
**TRANSITION OUT → Shot 5:** Hard cut on the glass visual rhyme. Shot 4C shows
the scout walking past glass walls with his reflection visible. Shot 5 opens on
the scout seen through glass (the car windshield). Glass → glass. The eye reads
this as continuous even though the location changed.

**Veo 3 prompt:**
```
A lone man in his late 40s walks down a long modern football academy corridor.
He wears a dark navy wool overcoat over a charcoal sweater, carrying a small
leather-bound notebook. The corridor has floor-to-ceiling glass walls on the
right side, revealing perfectly manicured green training pitches outside under
grey sky. The interior is clean, modern — polished concrete floor, minimal
design, recessed lighting. The camera tracks alongside him from the left at
walking pace, a medium shot from the waist up. He looks through the glass at
the training pitches as he walks, observing. His reflection is faintly visible
in the glass. He is the only person in the corridor. Through the glass, small
figures of players train in the distance on the pitch outside. The contrast is
the point: this is sterile, corporate, institutional — the opposite of the
rainy pitches. The man looks slightly out of place in this sleek environment.

The shot BEGINS with the man entering from the left edge of frame, the glass
corridor stretching ahead of him to the right. His dark coat is prominent against
the clean light interior. The shot ENDS with the camera still tracking and the
man passing a large glass panel — the final frame shows his dark reflection in
the glass in the foreground, with the green training pitch visible through the
glass behind his reflection. The last thing we see is the scout's dark shape
reflected in glass.

Shot on 35mm anamorphic lens, heavy film grain. Color: cool neutral tones inside,
desaturated green through the glass, soft diffused light from the overcast sky
outside.

AUDIO: Footsteps on polished concrete echoing in the corridor. Muffled sounds
of training — distant shouts, ball kicks — coming through the glass. No dialogue.
No voiceover. No music. No one speaks.

No text on screen. No titles. No logos. No brand names visible on walls.
```

**Camera:** Lateral tracking shot, walking pace, medium shot
**Duration:** 8 seconds (generate full 8, trim to 4 in post)
**Start frame:** Scout entering frame from left, clean glass corridor ahead
**End frame:** Scout's dark reflection in glass panel, green pitch visible through/behind the glass

---

## Shot 5 / 10 — THE INVISIBLE MAN (0:36–0:44)

**VO (added in post):** "Nobody talks about the person who found him."

**TRANSITION IN from Shot 4C:** Hard cut. Shot 4C ended on the scout's reflection
in glass. Shot 5 opens on the scout seen through glass (car windshield). The
visual rhyme: glass → glass. We saw his reflection in one pane, now we see
his silhouette through another. Both frames have the scout as a dark shape
behind/in glass.
**TRANSITION OUT → Shot 6:** Dissolve (1.5-2 seconds). This is the critical
real-to-game transition. Shot 5 ends with rain distorting the windshield — the
man becomes an indistinct dark blur behind rain-streaked glass. The game UI
scouting report has a dark background (#0A1628). The rain-blurred dark shape
dissolves into the dark game screen. In post, consider adding a subtle digital
noise/scan effect during the 1.5 sec dissolve to bridge analog→digital.

**Veo 3 prompt:**
```
Interior of a parked car on a grey overcast day. The camera is mounted on the
outside of the windshield looking in through the glass. A man in his late 40s
sits in the driver's seat. He wears a dark navy wool overcoat. He is a dark
silhouette against the grey light coming through the rear window. He holds a
folded newspaper in both hands, reading it — we can see the large format of
the paper but cannot read any text on it. The camera slowly pulls backward,
away from the windshield, revealing more of the car exterior and the setting:
the car is parked alone in an empty grey car park outside a football training
ground. In the background beyond the car, a chain-link fence and tall
floodlight poles are visible. The car park is wet — it has recently rained.
The sky is flat grey. No other cars. No other people. The man is completely
alone. As the camera pulls back, rain begins to lightly fall on the windshield,
distorting the view of the man inside. He becomes a blurred dark shape behind
the rain-streaked glass.

The shot BEGINS tight on the windshield — the man's silhouette is visible
through the glass, dark against grey rear-window light. The newspaper is
identifiable as a large folded paper shape in his hands. The shot ENDS with the
camera having pulled back and rain now covering the windshield — the man is no
longer clearly visible, just a dark indistinct blur behind the wet glass. The
final frame is predominantly dark: the dark blur of the man, the dark grey of
the wet glass, the dark wet car park. This darkness is intentional — it needs to
dissolve seamlessly into a dark game UI screen in post-production.

Shot on 35mm anamorphic lens, heavy film grain. Color: cold desaturated grey-blue,
muted, the darkest element is the man's silhouette. No warm tones in this shot —
it is deliberately cold and lonely.

AUDIO: Light rain beginning to fall on glass and metal. A car engine ticking as
it cools. Distant traffic. No dialogue. No voiceover. No music. No one speaks.

No text on screen. No titles. No readable text on the newspaper — it is just a
folded broadsheet shape. No logos on the car.
```

**Camera:** Slow pull-back from windshield exterior
**Duration:** 8 seconds
**Start frame:** Scout's silhouette clearly visible through windshield, newspaper in hands
**End frame:** Rain-blurred, dark, indistinct — the scout is a dark smudge behind wet glass. The frame is mostly dark tones. Ready to dissolve into the dark game UI.

---

## Shot 6 / 10 — GAME REVEAL (0:44–0:52)

**VO (added in post):** "TalentScout. You're not the manager. You don't pick the team. You don't set tactics."

**GAME FOOTAGE — not Veo 3.**

**TRANSITION IN from Shot 5:** 1.5-2 second crossfade dissolve. Shot 5's dark
rain-blurred windshield melts into the dark game UI background. The first game
screen should be a scouting report on a dark background — visually similar in
tone and darkness to the rain-streaked glass. Optional: add a subtle digital
noise/scanline effect during the dissolve to mark the shift from "real" to "game."
**TRANSITION OUT → Shot 7:** Hard cut. Game footage to game footage, standard
editing pace.

Screen-capture sequence from the game build (2 sec per cut):
1. Scouting report screen on dark background (match Shot 5's darkness)
2. Career selection screen — four specialization paths visible
3. World map with scouting assignment pins across countries
4. Calendar view populating with upcoming fixtures

**Capture note:** The FIRST frame of game footage must be a dark-background
screen (scouting report or player profile on the #0A1628 background). This is
what Shot 5's rain-blur dissolves into. If the first game frame is bright or
has a different background color, the dissolve will look bad.

---

## Shot 7 / 10 — GAME SCOPE (0:52–1:00)

**VO (added in post):** "You're the reason the manager has anyone worth picking."

**GAME FOOTAGE — not Veo 3.**

**TRANSITION IN from Shot 6:** Hard cut. Gameplay montage continues.
**TRANSITION OUT → Shot 8:** Hard cut. Pace increases.

Rapid gameplay montage (1.5 sec per cut):
- Player profile with attribute estimates and uncertainty ranges
- Shortlist screen with multiple player cards
- Rival scout notification — "Manchester City's scout attended the same match"
- Reputation meter visibly climbing
- Youth tournament bracket view

**Edit note:** Cuts are faster than Shot 6. Music is building. Energy rises.

---

## Shot 8 / 10 — CAREER ARC (1:00–1:08)

**VO (added in post):** "Start at the bottom. Non-league pitches. Youth tournaments nobody filmed. Prove yourself one report at a time."

**GAME FOOTAGE — not Veo 3.**

**TRANSITION IN from Shot 7:** Hard cut. Montage continues at pace.
**TRANSITION OUT → Shot 9A:** 1.5-2 second crossfade dissolve. This is the
game-to-real return transition. The last game frame should be a dark screen
(a career milestone notification or news headline on dark background). It
dissolves into the dark rainy night of Shot 9A. Mirror the Shot 5→6 transition
in reverse: dark UI melts into dark rain. Optional: reverse the digital noise
effect from the 5→6 transition — digital→analog.

Career progression montage (1.5 sec per cut):
- Early career: small match, basic report submitted
- Feedback notification: "Good eye — the club signed him"
- Data dashboard with statistical filters
- Network map of contacts — agents, coaches, journalists
- News headline: a player you scouted making a first-team debut
- Career tier advancing — the FINAL CUT of this montage should be a dark
  screen (news headline or milestone notification on #0A1628 background)
  to set up the dissolve into Shot 9A

**Capture note:** End this montage on a DARK game screen. Same logic as the
5→6 transition in reverse. Dark UI dissolves into dark rainy pitch.

## Shot 9A / 10 — THE CLOSE pt.1 (1:08–1:16)

**VO (added in post):** "Twenty-two countries. Three hundred and fifty clubs. Thousands of players who could be the next big thing. Or they could be nothing."

**TRANSITION IN from Shot 8:** 1.5-2 second crossfade dissolve. The dark game
UI melts into this dark, rainy, amber-lit scene. We return to the same ground
from the opening — the trailer comes full circle. The rain and amber floodlights
emerge out of the darkness of the game screen.
**TRANSITION OUT → Shot 9B:** Hard cut or seamless continuation. Both clips are
the same static camera angle at the same location. If generated as two clips,
hard cut works — the static framing hides the edit. If the scout hasn't fully
exited frame in 9A, use a 4-frame crossfade.

**Veo 3 prompt:**
```
Cinematic wide shot of a lone man sitting in empty concrete football terraces at
night in the rain. This is the same small South American youth ground: concrete
stepped terraces with no seats, two tall amber tungsten floodlight poles, chain-
link fence along one side, natural grass pitch. The match is over — the pitch
is empty, no players, no ball. The man sits alone in the middle of the empty
terrace, small in the wide frame. He wears a dark navy wool overcoat, collar
turned up. He holds a closed leather-bound notebook on his knee. Heavy rain
falls steadily through the amber floodlight beams. The concrete around him is
wet and reflective. The camera is positioned at a distance — a wide static shot
that emphasizes how alone and small he is in the empty ground. He is still for
four seconds, then slowly closes the notebook, tucks it inside his coat, and
stands up. He begins walking to the right, toward a dark exit tunnel at the end
of the terrace. The camera does not follow — it holds perfectly static. He walks
away and gets smaller in the frame.

The shot BEGINS with the wide frame already established — the empty ground,
the rain, the floodlights, and the man as a small dark figure sitting alone
in the center of the terraces. The overall frame is dark with amber pools of
light. This darkness allows it to emerge naturally from a dissolve with the
dark game UI. The shot ENDS with the man having walked to the right edge of
frame or beyond it — the camera holds static on the now-empty terraces. The
final frame should show the spot where he was sitting, now vacant, with the
amber-lit empty pitch behind it.

Shot on 35mm anamorphic lens, heavy film grain. Color: deep navy-black shadows,
warm amber floodlight pools on the wet concrete, the man is a dark silhouette
against the amber-lit pitch behind him.

AUDIO: Heavy rain on concrete. Dripping water. A distant metal gate creaking.
Complete silence otherwise — no crowd, no players, the match is over. No
dialogue. No voiceover. No music. No one speaks.

No text on screen. No titles. No logos. The man's face is not visible — he is
a silhouette and a dark shape at distance.
```

**Camera:** Wide static shot, no camera movement
**Duration:** 8 seconds
**Start frame:** Dark wide frame — empty terraces, rain, amber light, small figure sitting center. Dark enough to emerge from a dissolve with game UI.
**End frame:** Same frame, figure has walked away to the right. Empty terraces. Vacant seat area center-frame.

## Shot 9B / 10 — THE CLOSE pt.2 (1:16–1:20)

**VO (added in post):** *(quiet, almost to himself)* "That's the job. Knowing the difference."

**TRANSITION IN from Shot 9A:** Hard cut or seamless continuation. Same camera,
same angle, same location. The man is gone. We hold on the emptiness.
**TRANSITION OUT → Shot 10:** 1.5 second fade to black. The amber light and
rain slowly dim to pure black. Hold black for 0.5 seconds. Then the title
card fades in.

**Veo 3 prompt:**
```
The same small South American youth football ground at night in the rain, from
the same camera position as the previous shot. Same amber tungsten floodlights,
same concrete terraces, same empty pitch. No one is in the frame. The man has
walked away — he is gone. The camera holds on the exact same wide static frame
as the previous shot. In the center of the empty terrace where the man was
sitting, there is just wet concrete and a small puddle. The pitch glows amber-
green behind the terraces under the floodlights. Rain continues falling through
the light beams. The ground is completely deserted. No people anywhere. Just the
empty terraces, the empty pitch, the rain, and the amber light. The camera holds
perfectly still for the full duration. The composition emphasizes the absence —
where the man was, now there is nothing.

The shot BEGINS and ENDS on the same static frame. Nothing moves except the
rain and the light reflections in the puddles. The frame is identical to the
end frame of the previous shot but with no figure present. The overall tone
is dark — deep navy with pools of amber. This darkness will fade smoothly to
pure black in post-production.

Shot on 35mm anamorphic lens, heavy film grain. Shallow focus slowly shifts
from the empty terrace area in the foreground to the amber-lit pitch in the
background during the shot — a subtle, barely perceptible rack focus.
Color: deep navy-black, warm amber pools, wet reflective surfaces.

AUDIO: Rain on concrete, slowly fading quieter. A distant metal door closing
with a dull clang. Then just rain. No dialogue. No voiceover. No music.
No one speaks.

No text on screen. No titles. No logos.
```

**Camera:** Wide static hold, barely perceptible rack focus to pitch
**Duration:** 4 seconds
**Start frame:** Empty terraces, rain, amber light — identical framing to Shot 9A's end
**End frame:** Same frame, rain continuing. Dark overall. Ready to fade to black.

## Shot 10 / 10 — TAG (1:20–1:28)

**Motion graphics — not Veo 3.**

**TRANSITION IN from Shot 9B:** 1.5-second fade to pure black. Hold black 0.5 sec.

Create in After Effects, CapCut, or Canva:

- 0:00 — Pure black (continuing from 9B fade)

  **TALENTSCOUT**
  (Condensed bold sans-serif, all-caps, #F0EBE3 on #0A1628, tight letter-spacing)
- 0:02 — Tagline fades in below title:
  *Every club needs a manager. But someone had to find Messi first.*
  (#8A9BAE, regular weight, sentence case)
- 0:05 — Steam logo fades in below: "Available in Early Access"
- 0:06 — Small text fades in at bottom: **You spotted him first.**

## Veo 3 Generation Strategy

### Consistency Across Clips

1. **Generate Shot 1 first.** This establishes the look — the rain, the floodlight
   color, the film grain, the overall grade. If Shot 1 looks right, use it as the
   style reference for all subsequent night shots.

2. **Night shots group** (1, 2, 3, 9A, 9B): Same location, same rain, same lights.
   Generate in the same session. Include "same small South American youth football
   ground" in every prompt.

3. **Journey shots group** (4A, 4B, 4C): Different locations, same character.
   Include the full scout character description in each. Generate in the same
   session. If the man looks different across the three, regenerate — the coat
   and notebook are the visual anchors.

4. **Shot 5** (car) is isolated. Since the scout is a silhouette, consistency is
   more forgiving. The coat color is all that needs to match.

### Critical Transition Frames to Verify

Before assembling, check these frame-level matchups:

| Transition | Shot A End Frame | Shot B Start Frame | What Must Match |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 1→2 | Wide rainy pitch, amber light | Close-up hands in rain, amber light | Rain intensity, amber color temp |
| 2→3 | Blurry pitch visible past shoulder | Player on same pitch, low angle | Amber bokeh tone, rain intensity |
| 3→4A | Dark/motion blur, rightward drift | Golden light, turnstile | NOTHING — this goes through black. Mismatch is fine. |
| 4A→4B | Scout center-frame, warm gold | Scout center-frame, cold grey | Scout position + size in frame |
| 4B→4C | Scout from behind, seated, outdoor | Scout from behind/side, walking, indoor | Coat color, shoulder line |
| 4C→5 | Scout reflection in glass | Scout silhouette through glass | Dark shape + glass surface |
| 5→6 | Dark rain-blurred glass | Dark game UI (#0A1628) | Overall darkness level, color temp |
| 8→9A | Dark game screen | Dark rainy ground, amber hints | Overall darkness level |
| 9A→9B | Empty terraces, scout has exited right | Same empty terraces, no scout | Camera angle, framing, light |

### Per-Shot Generation Tips

| Shot | Likely Issues | Mitigation |
|------|--------------|------------|
| 1 | Floodlights might render as modern white LED | Emphasize "amber tungsten" and "warm golden" |
| 2 | Notebook text might generate readable gibberish | "impression of handwriting, not readable text" |
| 3 | Player's face might be too visible | "side-lit, profile only, face in shadow" |
| 3 | Camera might not drift right at end | "camera continues tracking rightward past the player" |
| 4A | Scout might face camera directly | "profile visible, not front-on" |
| 4A-C | Man doesn't match across clips | Lock the outfit, generate same session |
| 4C | End frame might not show glass reflection | "final frame shows his reflection in the glass" |
| 5 | Newspaper text will be garbled | "no readable text, just folded broadsheet shape" |
| 5 | End frame might not be dark enough for dissolve | "rain distorts windshield, man becomes indistinct dark blur" |
| 9A | Start frame might not be dark enough for dissolve | The wide night shot IS dark — verify black levels |
| 9A | Man might do too much in 8 sec | Sit still 4 sec, stand, walk. Simple. |
| 9B | Shot might feel lifeless | Rack focus adds movement. Rain reflections help. |

### Audio in Veo 3

Veo 3 generates audio by default. The prompts specify ambient-only sound.
In post-production:
- Keep Veo 3 rain/ambient as a foundation layer if it sounds natural
- Layer additional sound design: rain intensity, crowd, whistles, floodlight hum
- Add voiceover track on top
- Add music bed underneath everything
- Crossfade audio between clips independently of video transitions

If Veo 3's audio sounds wrong, mute it and rebuild entirely with SFX.

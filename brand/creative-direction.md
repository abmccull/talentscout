# TalentScout -- Steam Launch Creative Direction

Complete visual direction, trailer script, screenshot guidance, and ad creative concepts for TalentScout's Steam launch.

---

## 1. Steam Launch Trailer Script

**Format:** Cinematic reveal trailer, 75-90 seconds
**Style:** Voiceover (male, 30s-40s, British or South American-accented English -- the voice of a career scout reflecting on the job). Atmospheric, measured pacing. NOT an announcer voice. This should sound like a scout talking to himself after a long day.
**Music:** Minimal ambient drone building to atmospheric indie rock. Think: rain on corrugated iron, distant crowd noise fading in, then a slow-building instrumental with tension. Reference tracks: anything by Mogwai, Explosions in the Sky, or the quieter end of a FIFA soundtrack. NO EDM drops. NO epic orchestral swells. This is indie, not Marvel.

### Script

---

**[0:00-0:08] -- COLD OPEN**

*Visual: Black screen. Sound of rain. Slowly fade in: a poorly lit football pitch at night. Floodlights buzzing. A youth match in progress. Camera is behind a chain-link fence, like we're watching from outside the ground.*

**VO:** "Rain in Rosario."

*Visual: Cut to a wider shot. Small crowd. Maybe forty people. A touchline with no dugouts, just coaches standing in the wet.*

**VO:** "A youth cup semifinal. Nobody's watching."

---

**[0:08-0:20] -- THE MOMENT**

*Visual: Close-up of hands writing in a notebook. Rain spots on the page. A name is being underlined. Cut to a young player on the pitch -- we never see his face clearly. He receives the ball, plays a pass that splits the defence. Nothing flashy. Just vision.*

**VO:** "Except you."

*Beat. Two seconds of silence. Just rain and crowd noise.*

**VO:** "A left-footed centre-back. Sixteen years old. Reads the game two seconds ahead of everyone on that pitch."

*Visual: The young player looks up, scanning the field before the ball even arrives. Slow motion. We see what the scout sees -- the movement, the body shape, the intelligence.*

---

**[0:20-0:35] -- THE JOB**

*Visual: Montage. Quick cuts: A scout walking into a different ground -- this one sunlit, South American, open terraces. Then a cold English non-league ground with eight spectators. Then a modern academy facility with pristine pitches. Each location is distinct. The scout is always alone, always watching.*

**VO:** "Everyone talks about the manager. The tactics. The transfers. The trophies."

*Visual: Cut to a newspaper back page -- a big signing announced. Camera pulls back to reveal the newspaper is being held by hands in a car, in a parking lot outside a training ground.*

**VO:** "Nobody talks about the person who found him."

---

**[0:35-0:50] -- THE GAME REVEAL**

*Visual: Transition from cinematic footage to game UI. The notebook becomes a digital scouting report on screen. The match we were watching becomes the in-game match observation view. The young player's attributes appear, but they're uncertain -- question marks, ranges, your best guess based on what you saw.*

**VO:** "TalentScout."

*Visual: Show the game title card briefly, then immediately into gameplay. Career selection screen -- four paths flash by. A world map with scouting assignments. A calendar filling up with fixtures.*

**VO:** "You're not the manager. You don't pick the team. You don't set tactics."

*Visual: Player profile being filled in by hand. A shortlist growing. A rival scout at the same match -- he's watching the same player.*

**VO:** "You're the reason the manager has anyone worth picking."

---

**[0:50-1:05] -- THE SCOPE**

*Visual: Rapid gameplay montage set to the music building. Show the breadth:*
- *A non-league match at a muddy ground (career start)*
- *A scouting report being submitted, feedback received*
- *Reputation meter climbing*
- *A youth tournament bracket in South America*
- *A data dashboard with statistical filters*
- *A network map of contacts -- agents, coaches, journalists*
- *A player you scouted years ago making a first-team debut (news headline in-game)*
- *The phone ringing -- a bigger club wants to hire you*

**VO:** "Start at the bottom. Non-league pitches. Youth tournaments nobody filmed. Prove yourself one report at a time."

*Visual: Career progression -- the grounds get bigger, the players get better, the stakes get higher.*

**VO:** "Build your reputation. Build your network. Build your scouting empire."

---

**[1:05-1:18] -- THE CLOSE**

*Visual: Return to cinematic. The same rainy pitch from the opening. The same young player. But now we're seeing him from further away -- from the stands. A single figure sits in the rain, notebook in hand, watching.*

**VO:** "Twenty-two countries. Three hundred and fifty clubs. Thousands of players who could be the next big thing."

*Beat.*

**VO:** "Or they could be nothing."

*Visual: The scout closes his notebook. Stands up. Walks toward the exit. Camera holds on the empty seat, the pitch behind it.*

**VO (quieter, almost to himself):** "That's the job. Knowing the difference."

---

**[1:18-1:25] -- TAG**

*Visual: Black screen. Title card:*

**TALENTSCOUT**
*Every club needs a manager. But someone had to find Messi first.*

*Visual: Steam logo. "Available in Early Access." Wishlist CTA.*

*Final frame, small text:* **You spotted him first.**

---

### Trailer Production Notes

- **Total runtime:** ~80 seconds
- **Cinematic footage options:** Stock footage of youth football matches (rain, non-league, South American pitches), close-ups of notebooks/pens, stadiums at dusk. Alternatively: original footage shot at local youth grounds with permission, or stylized animation/motion graphics that blend into game UI.
- **Game footage needed:** Match observation screen, scouting report writing, career progression screens, world map, player profiles, contact network, shortlist management, news feed showing player developments.
- **Transitions:** Cinematic-to-gameplay transitions should feel seamless. The notebook becomes the report screen. The pitch becomes the in-game pitch. No hard cuts between "real" and "game" -- they're the same world.
- **Text on screen:** Minimal. Let the VO carry it. Only the title card and tagline at the end.
- **Sound design:** Rain is the connective tissue. It's present in the opening and the closing. Stadium ambience (distant chants, referee whistles) fades in and out. The music never overpowers the voice.

## 2. Steam Capsule Art Direction

### Color Palette

| Role | Color | Hex | Usage |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| Primary Dark | Deep pitch black / wet night sky | #0A1628 | Backgrounds, depth |
| Primary Accent | Floodlight amber / warm tungsten | #D4A843 | Highlights, warmth, the "light" in the darkness |
| Secondary Accent | Pitch green, slightly desaturated | #2D5A3D | Grass tones, subtle accents |
| Alert/Energy | Scout's red pen | #C23B3B | Report markings, underlines, key moments |
| Text Primary | Near-white, slight warm cast | #F0EBE3 | Headlines, title |
| Text Secondary | Muted fog grey | #8A9BAE | Secondary info, subtitles |

**Mood:** Atmospheric, nocturnal, rain-soaked. Think: the last fifteen minutes before the floodlights go off. Warm amber light cutting through cold blue-grey. Not dark for the sake of dark -- dark because that's when the real scouting happens. The loneliness is the point.

### Typography Direction

| Element | Style | Reference |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Game title "TALENTSCOUT" | Condensed, bold, all-caps sans-serif. Tight letter-spacing. Industrial but clean. Not decorative. | Think: Bebas Neue, Oswald, or a custom condensed gothic. The kind of type you'd see on a stadium scoreboard or a match programme cover. |
| Tagline | Regular weight, slightly wider tracking. Sentence case. Readable but understated. | A clean humanist sans-serif. The contrast to the bold title is the quiet confidence. |
| In-game UI text references | Monospaced or typewriter-adjacent for scouting reports/notes. | Gives the feeling of typed reports, database entries, the administrative side of scouting. |

### Main Capsule (460x215 / 231x87)

**Concept:** "The Scout in the Rain"

**Composition:**
- Left third: A silhouetted figure (the scout) seen from behind, sitting in empty stadium stands. Coat collar up. Notebook visible in hand.
- Center: A floodlit football pitch stretches out below, slightly out of focus. A youth match is in progress -- players are small, distant. The pitch glows amber-green under floodlights.
- Right third: Rain falling through the floodlight beams, creating visible light shafts.
- Bottom: "TALENTSCOUT" title overlaid, left-aligned, in the condensed bold typeface. Below it, smaller: "Every club needs a manager. But someone had to find Messi first."

**Key visual principle:** The scout is small in the frame. The world is big. This is about one person against the enormity of football, watching, deciding, alone.

**At 231x87 (small capsule):** Simplify. Just the title "TALENTSCOUT" with the rain-through-floodlights background. The silhouette is too small to read at this size. Let the atmospheric lighting and the strong title do the work.

**What to avoid:** Do not make this look like a Football Manager capsule (map/tactics board aesthetic). Do not show a crowded stadium -- the emptiness is the point. Do not use bright, saturated colors -- this is moody, not cheerful. No player faces (we're the scout, not the player).

### Library Hero Banner (3840x1240)

**Concept:** "The Scouting Journey" -- Panoramic Progression

**Composition:** A single continuous scene that reads left-to-right as a journey:

- **Far left:** A muddy non-league pitch in England. Grey sky. A single figure on the touchline. Chain-link fence. Portable goals. This is where the career starts.
- **Left-center:** A South American youth tournament. Sunlight, open terraces, colorful but modest. The scout is now in the stands, notebook out. A few other spectators.
- **Center:** An evening match at a mid-tier professional ground. Floodlights on. The atmosphere shifts from grassroots to professional. The scout is in a press area now, not the open stands.
- **Right-center:** A modern academy training facility. Glass and steel. Indoor viewing gallery. The scout reviews footage on a screen while watching a session below.
- **Far right:** A Champions League-level stadium at night. Massive. Lights blazing. The camera angle suggests we're high in the stands, looking down. Below, a player is warming up -- a player we found.

**Unifying elements:** Rain or atmosphere connects the scenes (mist, floodlight glow, weather). The color temperature shifts from cold grey (left) to warm amber (right) as the career progresses. The "TALENTSCOUT" title sits in the center, large, with generous negative space above and below.

**What to avoid:** This should not look like a collage. The scenes must blend into each other naturally, like a single continuous environment or a painted panorama. No hard borders between sections.

### Small Capsule (Search Results, 231x87)

**Concept:** Icon-level recognition

- The floodlight amber glow on dark blue-black.
- "TALENTSCOUT" title, large and centered.
- A subtle rain texture overlay.
- No imagery that requires detail to read -- at this size, atmosphere and typography are everything.

### Mood Board Description

If you were building a physical mood board for these capsules, it would contain:

- Photographs of empty football stadiums at night, floodlights on, rain falling
- Close-ups of handwritten scouting notebooks, pen marks, underlined names
- Shots of lone figures in stadium stands -- the person who arrived early and stays late
- South American youth football pitches -- Rosario, Buenos Aires, Montevideo
- English non-league grounds in the rain -- Dulwich Hamlet, Altrincham, that aesthetic
- Film stills from "The Damned United," "Scouting For Zlatan" (if it existed), the moody end of football cinema
- Color swatches: deep navy, amber, desaturated green, fog grey
- Typography samples: bold condensed sans-serifs, typewriter text, match-day programme headers
- NOT on the mood board: bright green grass, sunny match days, celebration photos, anything that looks like FIFA or PES cover art

---

## 3. Screenshot Direction

Six screenshots, sequenced to tell the story of a scouting career. Each screenshot should include a text overlay (Steam allows this) that frames what the player is seeing.

### Screenshot 1: "The Match"

**What to show:** The core match observation view. A youth match in progress. The UI shows the pitch, player positions, and the observation panel where the scout is taking notes. A player is highlighted -- the one we're watching. The setting should feel atmospheric: rain, evening, floodlights.

**Overlay text:** "WATCH THE MATCH. TRUST YOUR EYES."

**Purpose:** Immediately communicates the core mechanic. This is not a tactics screen. You're watching, not managing.

**Composition notes:** The match view should dominate. UI elements should be present but not overwhelming. The player being observed should have a subtle highlight or focus indicator. If possible, show an observation note being written in real-time ("Good composure under pressure. Plays with his head up.").

---

### Screenshot 2: "The Report"

**What to show:** The scouting report screen for a specific player. This is the output of observation -- your assessment. Show attribute estimates (with uncertainty ranges, not exact numbers), your written notes, a recommendation grade, and the "submit report" action. The player's name should be fictional but believable (a South American or European youth prospect).

**Overlay text:** "WRITE THE REPORT. STAKE YOUR REPUTATION."

**Purpose:** Shows the second half of the core loop. You watch, then you write. The uncertainty in attribute ratings communicates that this is not FM's "reveal attributes" -- this is judgment.

**Composition notes:** The report should look like a professional document, not a fantasy RPG stat screen. Clean, functional, slightly utilitarian. The handwritten/typed notes section should be prominent -- this is where the scout's voice lives.

---

### Screenshot 3: "The Career"

**What to show:** The career progression screen. Show the five tiers of scouting career (from non-league freelancer to chief scout). The player's current position should be visible (maybe tier 2 or 3 for an aspirational feel). Show reputation meter, recent assignments completed, and the path ahead.

**Overlay text:** "FROM NON-LEAGUE TO CHAMPIONS LEAGUE. ONE REPORT AT A TIME."

**Purpose:** Communicates long-term progression and ambition. This is not a single-session game. There is a career to build.

**Composition notes:** The progression should read visually as an upward journey. Whether it's a literal vertical path, a tier system, or a career timeline, the "where you started" and "where you're going" should both be visible.

---

### Screenshot 4: "The World"

**What to show:** The world map / assignment selection screen. Show multiple countries available (South America, Europe, Africa). Active scouting assignments with deadlines. A calendar with upcoming fixtures to attend. This should communicate scope -- 22 countries, hundreds of clubs, a living world.

**Overlay text:** "22 COUNTRIES. 350+ CLUBS. YOUR SCOUTING NETWORK."

**Purpose:** Communicates scale. The world is big and there's always somewhere to go, something to watch, someone to find.

**Composition notes:** The map should feel alive -- markers for upcoming matches, flags for countries, assignment briefs pinned to regions. Not a sterile strategy map. A working scout's planning tool.

---

### Screenshot 5: "The Rivalry"

**What to show:** A scenario where rival scouts are competing for the same player. Show a player profile with intel that other scouts have been spotted watching him. Maybe a notification: "Manchester City's chief scout attended the same match." The tension of competition -- you're not the only one hunting.

**Overlay text:** "YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY SCOUT IN THE STANDS."

**Purpose:** Communicates competitive pressure. This is not a solo optimization puzzle. There are rivals, time pressure, and the risk of losing a prospect to someone faster.

**Composition notes:** The rival scout element should feel like a threat, not just flavor text. A notification or event log showing recent rival activity. The player in question should be clearly desirable -- high potential, watched by multiple clubs.

---

### Screenshot 6: "The Payoff"

**What to show:** The ultimate reward. A news event or notification showing that a player you scouted years ago has made his first-team debut, or been called up to a national team, or been signed for a record fee. Your scouting report from when he was 16 is referenced. Your name is attached to the discovery.

**Overlay text:** "YOU SPOTTED HIM FIRST."

**Purpose:** The emotional payoff. The tagline made real. This is the moment every screenshot has been building toward -- the proof that your judgment was right.

**Composition notes:** This should feel like a moment of vindication. A news headline, a notification, a career milestone. If possible, show the original report date versus the current achievement -- "Scouted: 2024, Age 16, Third Division Argentina" next to "2028: Signed by Barcelona for 45M." The time gap tells the story.

---

### Screenshot Sequence Summary

| # | Title | Core Mechanic Shown | Emotional Beat |
|---|-------|---------------------|----------------|
| 1 | The Match | Match observation | Atmosphere, immersion |
| 2 | The Report | Report writing | Judgment, stakes |
| 3 | The Career | Career progression | Ambition, journey |
| 4 | The World | World/assignment map | Scale, exploration |
| 5 | The Rivalry | Rival scout competition | Tension, urgency |
| 6 | The Payoff | Long-term player development | Vindication, pride |

## 4. Ad Creative Concepts

Three ad concepts, each using a different positioning angle. Designed for static/image ads with text -- executable with game screenshots, simple graphics, and atmospheric photography.

### Ad Concept A: "The Eye Test"

**Positioning angle:** The Eye Test -- no stats screen, just your judgment.

**Platforms:** Twitter/X card (1200x675), Reddit promoted post (1200x628)

**Visual concept:** A dark, atmospheric image. A rain-soaked youth football pitch at night, seen through a chain-link fence. Floodlights create amber light shafts through the rain. In the foreground, slightly out of focus: the edge of a notebook and a pen. The pitch is sharp in the background. One player is circled -- hand-drawn, red pen, on the image itself as if the scout has literally marked the photo.

**Headline:** "No star ratings. No attribute screens. Just you, a rainy pitch, and a 16-year-old who might be the next big thing."

**Body text:** "TalentScout -- the football scouting simulation where your eyes are the only tool that matters. Watch matches. Judge talent. Stake your reputation. Now in Early Access on Steam."

**CTA:** "Wishlist on Steam" / "Available Now in Early Access"

**Design notes:**
- The hand-drawn red circle on the player is the key visual device. It says "scouting" instantly without explanation.
- Keep the image dark and moody. This is not a bright, colorful game ad. It's atmospheric.
- The headline does the heavy lifting. It should be in the warm near-white (#F0EBE3) against the dark image.
- Body text is small, secondary. The headline + image should work without it.

**At thumbnail size (Twitter card preview):** The red circle on the dark background should still be readable. Headline text should be large enough to catch at scroll speed.

---

### Ad Concept B: "The Other Side of the Transfer"

**Positioning angle:** The Other Side of the Transfer -- before the fee, before the announcement.

**Platforms:** Twitter/X card (1200x675), Steam banner (940x300)

**Visual concept:** Split composition. Left half: a glossy, bright transfer announcement graphic (the kind clubs post on social media -- "WELCOME TO [CLUB]" with the player holding the shirt, confetti, club colors). Right half: the same image but desaturated, faded, almost ghostly -- and overlaid on top of it, a scouting report. Handwritten notes. A date from three years earlier. A recommendation: "SIGN HIM." The contrast is the message: before the glamour, there was a scout who saw it first.

**Headline:** "Before the transfer fee. Before the announcement. There was a scout in the rain who saw it first."

**Body text:** "Football Manager lets you click 'Sign Player.' TalentScout is everything that happens before that click. Now in Early Access."

**CTA:** "Play the other side. Wishlist on Steam."

**Design notes:**
- The split image is the concept. Left = the public story (the transfer). Right = the real story (the scout's work). If this can be executed as a subtle animation (the transfer announcement fading to reveal the scouting report underneath), it works even better as a GIF or short video.
- The headline can sit across the bottom of the full image in a dark band.
- The FM reference in the body text is intentional -- it positions TalentScout as the complement/alternative for FM players specifically.
- For the Steam banner (940x300), the horizontal format accommodates the split composition naturally.

---

### Ad Concept C: "The Wonderkid Hunter"

**Positioning angle:** The Wonderkid Hunter -- for FM players who already obsess over this.

**Platforms:** Reddit promoted post (1200x628), Twitter/X card (1200x675)

**Visual concept:** A mock-up of an in-game scouting report for a fictional wonderkid. Clean, UI-style presentation. The player profile shows: Name (something evocative -- "Lucas Ferreyra, 16, CF, CA Independiente Reserves"), estimated attributes with uncertainty ranges, your scouting notes ("First touch is elite. Decision-making beyond his age. Needs physical development -- 18 months."), and a recommendation stamp: "FUTURE STAR -- SIGN BEFORE RIVAL INTEREST."

Below the report, a single line of real-world context:

**Headline:** "You already spend hours finding wonderkids in FM. This is the game that makes it the whole point."

**Body text:** "Four scouting career paths. 22 countries. Thousands of prospects. Your eyes, your judgment, your reputation on the line. TalentScout -- Early Access on Steam."

**CTA:** "This is the game you've been looking for. Wishlist now."

**Design notes:**
- This ad speaks directly to the FM community. It assumes they know what wonderkids are, what scouting in FM feels like, and why it's addictive. Zero explanation needed.
- The scouting report should look like an actual game screenshot -- not a mockup. This is showing the product directly. If actual game screenshots of the report UI exist, use them.
- The dark background of the game UI (#0A1628) works as the ad background. The report is the visual. The headline sits above or below.
- On Reddit specifically, this format works because FM subreddit users will immediately recognize the scouting report format and understand the value proposition in seconds.
- The headline "You already spend hours..." is a mirror statement. It tells the audience: we know you, this is for you. That recognition is the hook.

---

### Ad Sizing Reference

| Platform | Size | Format | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| Twitter/X card | 1200x675 | PNG or GIF | Large image card. Headline in image, tweet text = body + CTA |
| Reddit promoted post | 1200x628 | PNG | Image post. Title = headline. Body in comments or post text |
| Steam banner (Daily Deal / Featured) | 940x300 | PNG | Wide format. Title + tagline + key art. Must work at a glance |
| Steam small banner | 460x215 | PNG | Same as main capsule. Reuse capsule art |

---

## Visual Identity Summary

### The TalentScout Look

Every visual asset for TalentScout should feel like it belongs to the same world:

**Atmosphere over action.** This is not a game about goals and celebrations. It's about watching, waiting, and deciding. Every image should have that feeling -- the observer's perspective, not the participant's.

**Night over day.** Most scouting happens under floodlights, in the evening, in the rain. The default lighting should be nocturnal: amber floodlights, deep blue-black skies, wet surfaces reflecting light.

**Lone figure in a big world.** The scout is always one person against the enormity of global football. Compositions should emphasize this -- small figure, large environment. Empty stands. Vast pitch. One notebook.

**Warm amber on cold blue.** The signature color interaction. Cold, atmospheric backgrounds with warm pools of light. The amber is hope, knowledge, the floodlight that reveals talent. The blue-black is the unknown, the vast pool of players who might be something or might be nothing.

**Uncertainty is the aesthetic.** Unlike FM, which reveals numbers, TalentScout is about judgment under uncertainty. Visuals should reflect this: soft focus, rain, distance, partial views. We never see the player's face clearly in marketing materials. He's a silhouette, a possibility, not a confirmed commodity.

---

## What's Next

These concepts are direction -- not finished assets. To execute:

1. **Trailer:** Needs game footage capture, stock/original atmospheric footage, voiceover recording, and sound design/music licensing.
2. **Capsule art:** Needs a digital artist or compositor to build the scene from the direction above. Can be illustrated, photo-composited, or a blend.
3. **Screenshots:** Need actual game builds with UI in the states described. Overlay text can be added in any image editor.
4. **Ads:** Can be built from game screenshots + the concepts above using Figma, Canva, or any design tool. The "Eye Test" and "Other Side" concepts may benefit from light photo manipulation.

## Source Content Extraction

```
CORE INSIGHT:
Every football game is about the manager. This is the first game about
the scout — the person who finds the talent that makes everything else possible.

SUPPORTING POINTS:
1. You watch matches and judge players with your own eyes — no star ratings
2. Four distinct career paths (Youth Scout, First Team, Regional Expert, Data Scout)
3. 22 countries, 350+ clubs, career starts at muddy school pitches
4. Build your network, reputation, and scouting empire over time
5. Rival scouts are hunting the same wonderkids — spot talent first or lose it

STORIES/EXAMPLES:
- Rain in Rosario. Youth cup semifinal nobody's watching. A 16-year-old
  left-footed centre-back reads the game two seconds ahead.
- Career progression from non-league touchlines to Champions League shortlists

DATA/PROOF:
- 22 countries, 350+ clubs
- 4 career paths
- 5-tier career progression
- FM26 at 22% positive Steam reviews (displaced veterans looking for depth)

QUOTABLE LINES:
- "You see it. Nobody else does. That's the job. That's the whole game."
- "This is the game for people who watch U-17 tournaments on purpose."
- "You spotted him first."
- "You're not the manager. You're the reason the manager has anyone worth picking."
- "Find the wonderkid before the world does."

CONTRARIAN TAKES:
- The most important person at a football club isn't the manager
- Every football game got it wrong — they skipped the most interesting role
- You don't need a stats screen to evaluate talent. You need eyes.

### Tweet 1 — The Announcement (standalone)

```
We made a football game where you're not the manager.

You're the scout.

TalentScout. Coming to Steam Early Access.

### Tweet 2 — The Scene-Setter (standalone)

```
Rain in Rosario. A youth cup semifinal nobody's watching.

A left-footed centre-back, 16 years old, reads the game two seconds ahead of everyone on the pitch.

You see it. Nobody else does.

That's the whole game.
```

> [IMAGE NOTE: In-game screenshot of a rainy match scene — atmospheric, dark sky, a few spectators scattered in the stands. If no screenshot ready, a cinematic concept art of the scene.]

### Tweet 3 — Hot Take (standalone)

```
Every football game for 30 years: "Be the manager."

Nobody ever asked: who found the players?

That's the game we made.
```

> [No image — let the text work. Short tweets without media can outperform on X when the take is sharp enough.]

### Tweet 4 — Self-Selecting (standalone)

```
This is the game for people who watch U-17 tournaments on purpose.

You know who you are.
```

> [GIF NOTE: If available, a short loop of in-game match observation — a player making a run, the scout's notebook appearing. If not, a GIF of rain falling on an empty football pitch.]

### Tweet 5 — The FM Angle (standalone)

```
You already spend hours hunting wonderkids in FM.

We made a game where that's not a side quest. It's the entire point.
```

### Tweet 6 — Career Tease (standalone)

```
Four ways to scout:

- Youth Scout (academy circuits, U-17 tournaments)
- First Team Scout (the manager needs a left-back by Tuesday)
- Regional Expert (you know every pitch in South America)
- Data Scout (find the breakout before the stats go public)

Which one are you?
```

> [IMAGE NOTE: Simple graphic showing the four paths — could be four icons or four atmospheric photos representing each path. Clean, not cluttered.]

### Tweet 7 — Scale (standalone)

```
22 countries. 350+ clubs. Your career starts at muddy school pitches with no reputation and a notebook.

Build your scouting empire from nothing.
```

> [IMAGE NOTE: In-game world map or a screenshot of the country/league selection screen.]

### Tweet 8 — The Contrarian (standalone)

```
Hot take: the most important person at a football club isn't the manager.

It's the scout who found the players the manager picks.

Someone had to spot Messi before Messi was Messi.
```

> [No image needed — hot take format performs better as pure text on X.]

### Tweet 9 — Indie Dev Honesty (standalone)

```
We built this because Football Manager never let us be the scout.

So we made a whole game about it.

Small team. Big obsession. TalentScout on Steam now.

### Tweet 10 — Full Announcement Thread

**Tweet 10a (Hook):**
```
We just launched TalentScout on Steam Early Access.

It's a football scouting simulation. You're not the manager. You're the person who finds the talent.

Here's what it is and why we made it:

Thread
```

**Tweet 10b:**
```
Every football game puts you in the dugout.

TalentScout puts you in the stands with a notebook, watching a youth cup semifinal in the rain, trying to figure out if the 16-year-old centre-back in front of you is the real thing.
```

**Tweet 10c:**
```
You watch matches. You judge players with your own eyes. No star ratings. No attribute screens telling you the answer.

You write scouting reports. Stake your reputation on them. Get it right and clubs come calling. Get it wrong and your phone goes quiet.
```

**Tweet 10d:**
```
Four career paths:

Youth Scout — academy circuits, wonderkid hunting
First Team Scout — the manager's shortlist, deadline pressure
Regional Expert — you own a territory, you know every pitch
Data Scout — statistical anomalies, breakout prediction

Each one plays differently. All feed the same addiction.
```

**Tweet 10e:**
```
22 countries. 350+ clubs. You start at non-league grounds with no floodlights and a bus ticket.

Build your reputation report by report. Your network is your currency. Agents, coaches, contacts — every relationship opens or closes doors.
```

**Tweet 10f:**
```
Rival scouts are hunting the same players you are. Spot the wonderkid first or watch someone else take the credit.

Every report you submit is a bet. Discover a future star and your name carries weight for years. Miss a red flag and you'll spend seasons earning trust back.
```

**Tweet 10g:**
```
We built this because we're FM players who always wished the scouting side was the whole game.

Early Access. Small team. Built by people who care about this niche more than is probably healthy.

Wishlist / buy on Steam: [LINK]

You spotted him first.
```

> [IMAGE NOTE for thread: Attach key art to Tweet 10a. Attach in-game screenshots to 10c (scouting report), 10d (career path selection), 10e (world map). Leave 10b and 10f as text-only for pacing.]

## Post 1: r/footballmanagergames

**Angle: The Wonderkid Hunter**

---

**Title:** We built a game about the part of FM we wished was the whole game — being the scout. TalentScout is now on Steam Early Access.

**Body:**

Hey everyone.

We're a small dev team and we've been lurking in this sub for years. Most of us have thousands of hours in FM. We've all had the same experience: you send your scouts to South America, you get that report back on a 16-year-old with insane potential, you sign him, and you feel like a genius.

That moment — the discovery, the find, the "I spotted him before anyone else" — is the best feeling in Football Manager. But in FM, it's a side feature. You click a few buttons, read a report someone else wrote, and move on to setting your tactics.

We wanted that feeling to be the entire game.

**So we built TalentScout.**

You play as the scout. Not the manager. You don't pick the team. You don't set tactics. You don't negotiate contracts. You're the person who finds the talent that makes all of that possible.

**What does that actually mean in practice?**

You attend matches. You sit in the stands — sometimes at a packed league game, sometimes at a youth tournament with twelve people watching in the rain — and you observe players in real time. No attribute screen tells you whether the kid in front of you has the composure to step up two divisions. That's your call.

You write scouting reports based on what your eyes tell you. You submit those reports to clubs. If you're right — if the player you recommended breaks into the first team — your reputation grows. If you're wrong, it takes a hit. Every report is a bet on your own judgment.

**The career structure:**

You start at the bottom. Non-league pitches, school tournaments, no reputation. You work your way up through five tiers, building a network of agents, coaches, managers, and contacts along the way. Your network is your actual currency — it opens doors that databases can't.

There are four career paths:

- **Youth Scout** — You're in the academy circuits, the U-17 tournaments, looking at 15-year-olds and trying to project what they'll be at 21. This is the wonderkid hunting path.
- **First Team Scout** — The manager needs a left-back under 28 for less than 20 million and you've got a week to find one. Deadline pressure, specific briefs, real consequence.
- **Regional Expert** — You own a territory. You know every pitch, every academy, every prospect in your region. Clubs call you when they want the deep cut.
- **Data Scout** — Query databases, detect statistical anomalies, predict breakouts before they happen. The moneyball path.

Each one plays differently but they all feed the same addiction: being right about a player before anyone else.

**Scale:**

22 countries. 350+ clubs. Transfer windows open and close. Players develop, decline, transfer, retire. Rival scouts are hunting the same wonderkids you are. It's a living football world and it keeps moving whether you're watching or not.

**Why Early Access?**

Because we know who this game is for — it's for the people in this sub. The FM community that already does this in their head while playing FM. We want to build it with you, not just for you. Your feedback shapes what gets built next.

The core loop is fully playable. You can run a complete scouting career from non-league to chief scout right now. What's coming: deeper narrative events, expanded player personality systems, historical scenarios, multiplayer scouting leagues, enhanced modding tools.

**Pricing will increase** as we add content. Early Access gets you in at the lowest price it'll ever be.

Steam link: [LINK]

If you've ever wished FM let you just be the scout, this is the game. We'd genuinely love to hear what you think.

**[Post engagement notes: Stay active in the comments for at least 3-4 hours after posting. Answer every question directly. Don't get defensive about comparisons to FM — lean into them. "We love FM. We just wanted the scouting part to be its own thing." If anyone asks about specific mechanics (match engine, database size, modding), give detailed honest answers. This community respects transparency and punishes marketing speak.]**

## Post 2: r/indiegaming

**Angle: The Untold Role**

---

**Title:** Every football game for 30 years has been about the manager. We made one about the scout. TalentScout — Steam Early Access.

**Body:**

Quick pitch: you play as a football scout. Not the manager. You attend matches, observe players, write scouting reports, and build your career from non-league touchlines to Champions League shortlists.

The hook is the "eye test" — there's no attribute screen telling you if a player is good. You watch them play. You make the call. You stake your reputation on it.

22 countries, 350+ clubs, four career paths (Youth Scout, First Team Scout, Regional Expert, Data Scout), five-tier career progression.

Small indie team. We're FM (Football Manager) players who always wished the scouting side was the whole game, so we built it.

Early Access on Steam now: [LINK]

Happy to answer any questions about the design, the tech, or why we thought a football scouting sim needed to exist.

## Post 3: r/soccer

**Angle: The Grassroots Fantasy / Fun Hook**

---

**Title:** Ever wanted to be the scout who found Messi before anyone knew his name? Someone actually made a game about that.

**Body:**

Not a manager game. Not a FIFA/FC thing. An actual scouting simulation.

You play as a football scout. You attend matches — youth tournaments, lower league games, academy showcases — and evaluate players by watching them. No stats screen tells you the answer. You observe the match, decide if the kid is the real thing, and write a report that puts your reputation on the line.

Your career starts at muddy school pitches with nobody watching. If you're good — if you spot the right players and your reports hold up — you work your way up to scouting for top-flight clubs.

Four career paths including a Youth Scout route (the wonderkid hunter) and a Data Scout route (moneyball vibes). 22 countries, 350+ clubs.

It's called TalentScout. Just hit Steam Early Access. Built by a small team of FM addicts who wanted the scouting part to be its own game.

The pitch that sold us on making it: "Rain in Rosario. A youth cup semifinal nobody's watching. A left-footed centre-back, 16 years old, reads the game two seconds ahead of everyone on the pitch. You see it. Nobody else does. That's the job."

## FM Community Discord Servers — Tease Messages (x3)

**Angle: The Wonderkid Hunter**

**[These are written to be posted by the dev team in general chat or game-discussion channels of FM community Discords, where self-promotion rules allow it. Adjust per server rules. Always check rules first and get mod permission if required.]**

---

**Tease 1 — For general FM discussion channels:**

```
Genuine question for this server — how many hours do you reckon you've spent just scouting in FM? Not managing. Not setting tactics. Just sending scouts, reading reports, hunting wonderkids.

We built a whole game around that. It's called TalentScout. You play as the scout. You attend matches, evaluate players yourself, write reports, build your career.

Just went live on Steam Early Access today. Not trying to replace FM — just giving the scouting obsession its own game.

[LINK] if anyone's curious. Happy to answer questions.
```

---

**Tease 2 — For wonderkid/scouting discussion channels:**

```
If you're the type who has a spreadsheet of Brazilian second-division wonderkids you update for fun... we made TalentScout for you specifically.

Football scouting sim. No managing. You watch matches, judge players with your own eyes, and stake your reputation on your reports. Four career paths including a Youth Scout route that's basically wonderkid hunting as a full game.

Steam Early Access as of today: [LINK]
```

---

**Tease 3 — For FM frustration/discussion threads (use when FM26 criticism is being discussed):**

```
Not here to pile on FM — genuinely love the series, thousands of hours across the lot of us.

But if the scouting side was always your favourite part, we built something you might like. TalentScout is a standalone scouting sim. You're the scout, not the manager. Watch matches, evaluate talent, build your career from non-league to chief scout.

Just launched on Steam Early Access: [LINK]

Built by FM players who wanted the scouting part to be the whole game.

A youth cup semifinal that nobody's watching. A left-footed centre-back, 16 years old, reads the game two seconds ahead of everyone on the pitch.

TalentScout is a football scouting simulation. You're not the manager — you're the person who finds the talent. Watch matches. Judge players. Write reports. Build your career from muddy school pitches to Champions League shortlists.

Every football game for 30 years put you in the dugout. This one puts you in the stands with a notebook.

> [POST NOTE: Pin this as a community post alongside the trailer video upload. The trailer should lead — atmospheric, moody, rain and floodlights, the scout's-eye-view of a match.

## Steam Discussion Forum — Launch Announcement

**Angle: The Untold Role + Indie Dev Honesty**

**Forum: General Discussions (pinned)**

**Title:** TalentScout is live on Steam Early Access — here's what's in, what's coming, and how to talk to us

**Body:**

Hey everyone.

TalentScout is officially available in Early Access. If you're reading this, you're probably one of the people we built this game for — so thank you for being here.

**What TalentScout is:**

A football scouting simulation. You play as the scout, not the manager. You attend matches, observe players, write scouting reports, and build a career from non-league touchlines to Champions League shortlists. The core idea: you judge players with your own eyes. No attribute screen gives you the answer. You watch, you evaluate, you put your reputation on every report you submit.

**What's playable right now:**

- Full scouting career from non-league to chief scout (five-tier progression)
- Four career paths: Youth Scout, First Team Scout, Regional Expert, Data Scout
- Match observation and report writing system
- 22 countries with full league structures and 350+ clubs
- Contact networks — agents, coaches, managers, journalists
- Financial management for your scouting operation
- Rival scout competition
- Transfer windows, player development arcs, the full living football world

**What's coming during Early Access:**

- Deeper narrative events and storylines
- Expanded player personality and development systems
- Historical scenarios (famous scouting discoveries you can replay)
- Multiplayer scouting leagues
- Enhanced modding tools
- Community-requested features — that's the whole point of Early Access

**How long will Early Access last?**

We're planning 8-12 months. Updates will be frequent. We'll share our roadmap and you'll have direct input on priorities.

**Will the price go up?**

Yes. As content is added, the price increases. Early Access is the lowest price TalentScout will ever be.

**How to reach us:**

- **Bug reports:** Please use the Bug Reports subforum. Include your save file if possible — it helps us reproduce issues faster.
- **Feedback and suggestions:** The Suggestions subforum is monitored daily.
- **Discord:** [DISCORD LINK] — fastest way to talk to the team directly.
- **This forum:** We're here. We'll be reading and responding.

**Who we are:**

Small indie team. Most of us have thousands of hours in Football Manager. We always wished the scouting side was the whole game — the wonderkid hunting, the youth tournaments, the thrill of being right about a player before anyone else knew his name. So we built it.

We're not pretending to be a AAA studio. We're building a deep, niche game for a specific audience. If you're the kind of person who watches U-17 tournaments on purpose, who has opinions about which South American leagues produce the best centre-backs, who knows what PA means without being told — this is for you.

Thanks for being early. Your feedback over these first weeks and months will shape what TalentScout becomes.

Now go find some players.

— The TalentScout Team

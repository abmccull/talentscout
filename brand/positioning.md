## Primary Positioning

Angle: The Untold Role
Statement: Every football game lets you be the manager. None let you be the person who actually finds the talent -- until now.
Psychology: FM players already romanticize the scouting side of football. They make spreadsheets of wonderkids, they obsess over youth intake day, they send scouts to South America for fun. TalentScout gives that obsession its own game -- and frames scouting as the heroic, underappreciated role it actually is in real football.
Headline direction: "Every club needs a manager. But someone had to find Messi first."
Best for: Steam launch to FM community. Positions clearly against the dominant competitor without attacking it -- occupies the role FM skips over.

## Competitive Landscape Summary

Sophistication: Stage 1-2 -- New category (scout simulation) within a Stage 3 market (football management)
Primary alternative: Football Manager scouting module (a feature, not the game); or doing nothing (no standalone scout sim exists)

Saturated claims:
- "Step into the dugout" / manage your club / be the manager
- "Tactical depth" / "tactical realism" / "set your tactics"
- "Build a dynasty" / "lead your team to glory"
- "Most realistic football simulation"
- "Sign wonderkids" / "scout hidden gems" (as a sub-feature)

White space identified:
- Nobody positions the SCOUT as the protagonist -- every game is about the manager
- No game simulates the physical act of scouting: attending matches, watching players live, writing observation reports
- The grassroots-to-glory journey from a scout's perspective is completely untouched
- The "eye test" fantasy -- trusting your own judgment over data -- has no game champion
- FM26 is hemorrhaging its hardcore base (22% positive Steam reviews) -- displaced veterans are looking for depth

## All Angles Explored

### Angle 1: The Untold Role (selected)
- Statement: Every football game lets you be the manager. None let you be the person who actually finds the talent -- until now.
- Headline: "Every club needs a manager. But someone had to find Messi first."

### Angle 2: The Eye Test
- Statement: No stats screen. No star ratings. Just you, a rainy pitch, and a 16-year-old who might be the next big thing. Trust your eyes.
- Headline: "Football's most important skill isn't tactics. It's seeing what others miss."

### Angle 3: The Other Side of the Transfer
- Statement: Football Manager lets you click 'Sign Player.' TalentScout is everything that happens before that click -- the months of watching, evaluating, and recommending that makes the transfer possible.
- Headline: "Before the transfer fee. Before the announcement. There was a scout in the rain who saw it first."

### Angle 4: The Grassroots Fantasy
- Statement: Start at Sunday league pitches and school tournaments. Build your reputation report by report. End up as the chief scout who shapes a club's future for decades.
- Headline: "From muddy school pitches to Champions League shortlists. Your scouting career starts at the bottom."

### Angle 5: The Wonderkid Hunter
- Statement: You already spend hours finding wonderkids in Football Manager. This is the game that makes that obsession the entire point.
- Headline: "You don't pick the team. You don't set tactics. You find the next Messi. That's the whole game."
